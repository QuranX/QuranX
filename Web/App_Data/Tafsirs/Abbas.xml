      <text>And on his authority it is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, regarding the saying of Allah, Exalted is He, (Praise be to Allah): 'He says: laudation is Allah's in that He is kind towards His created beings and, hence, they praise Him. It is also said that laudation is Allah's because of His excessive blessings upon His servants whom He has guided to believe in Him. It is also said: laudation, absolute unity and godhood all belong to Allah Who has neither progeny, partner, helper nor an assistant. (Lord of the worlds): Lord of any that has a spirit and walks about on the face of the earth and also of the dwellers of heaven. It is also said that this means: the Master of the jinn and human beings. It is also said that (Lord of the worlds) means the Creator of all created beings, their Provider and the One Who changes them from one state into another.</text>

      <text>And on his authority&gt;'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak&gt;'Ali Ibn Ishaq al-Samarqandi&gt;Muhammad Ibn Marwan&gt;al-Kalbi&gt;Abu Salih that Ibn 'Abbas said, concerning Allah's saying, Exalted is He, (Alif. Lam. Mim): 'Alif stands for Allah, Lam for the Archangel Gabriel (Jibril) and Mim for Muhammad. It is also said Alif stands for Allah's blessings (ala'uh), Lam for His kindness (lutfuh) and Mim for His dominion (mulkuh). It is also said that Alif stands for the beginning of the Name Allah, Lam for the beginning of His Name the Kind (al-Latif) and Mim for the beginning of His Name the Glorious (al-Majid). It is also said that only Allah knows the meaning of these disjointed letters; while some maintain that it is an oath that He made.</text>

      <text>(This is the Scripture), i.e. this is the Book that Muhammad (pbuh) is reciting to you; (whereof there is no doubt). There is no doubt that it has come from Me; if you believe in it, I shall guide you, but if you do not believe in it, I will torment you. It is also said that (This is the Scripture) refers to the Guarded Tablet. It is also said that this means: This is the Book that I promised to reveal to you on the Day of the Covenant (yawm al-mithaq). It is also said (this is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt) means there is no doubt that the description and traits of Muhammad are found in the Torah and Gospel. (A guidance unto those who ward off (evil)), means that the Qur'an is an exposition for those who ward off disbelief, associating partners with Allah and indecencies. It is also said that it means: it is a favour to the believers; or that it means it is a mercy unto those who ward off evil from among the community of Muhammad (pbuh).</text>

      <text>(Who believe in the unseen), that which is hidden from them such as Paradise, hell, the Bridge over hell, the Scale, the Resurrection, the Reckoning, etc. It is also said that this means: that they believe in the unseen which is revealed in the Qur'an and also in that which is not revealed therein. It is also said that the unseen is Allah Himself. (And establish worship), they perform to completion the five prescribed prayers, including the ablution that precedes them, the bowing and prostrations which are parts of them and also what is obligated in these prayers in terms of appointed timing. (And spend of that We have bestowed upon them), and of that which We have given them of wealth they give to charity. It is also said that this means: they give the poor-due (Zakat) from their wealth. The reference here is to Abu Bakr and his companions.</text>

      <text>(These) who have these traits, (are on guidance from their Lord), they enjoy favour, mercy and clear exposition that has come down from their Lord, (and these are the successful ones), the ones who shall escape Allah's wrath and torment. It is also said that this refers to those who have apprehended and found what they were seeking and have escaped the evil of that from which they were fleeing, and these are the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh).</text>

This refers in particular to the Jews Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and Judayy Ibn Akhtab. It is also said that it refers to the idolaters of Mecca 'Utbah [Ibn Rabi'ah], Shaybah [Ibn Rabi'ah] and al-Walid [Ibn al-Mughirah].</text>

      <text>(They try to deceive Allah) contravene against Him and denying Him in secret. It is also said that this means that they were so daring with Allah to the extent that they thought they had deceived Him; (and those who believe), Abu Bakr and all the Companions of Muhammad Allah bless him and give him peace; (and they deceive) lie to (none save themselves; but they perceive not), they do not know that Allah informs His Prophet about that which lies secret in their hearts.</text>

      <text>(Allah (Himself) doth mock them), in the Hereafter, i.e. He will open a gate of Paradise for them and then shut it before their eyes and so the believers will mock them.

      <lastVerse>17</lastVerse>
      <text>(Their likeness), the likeness of the hypocrites vis-"-vis Muhammad (pbuh) (is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire), lights a fire in the darkness in order to provide safety for his family, property and person, (and when it sheddeth its light around him), when it sheds its light and he sees what is around him and feels secure, at that very moment the Fire is put out. Likewise, the hypocrites believed openly in Muhammad (pbuh) as well as in the Qur'an and by doing so they felt their persons, families and properties were safe, avoiding in the process imprisonment or death. But when they die (Allah taketh away their light), the benefit of their [outward] faith, (and leaveth them in darkness) facing the hardships of the grave, (where they cannot see) any comfort. It is also said this simile refers to the Jews. In this respect, the likeness of the Jews vis-"-vis Muhammad (pbuh) is like a man who raises a flag in a lost battle and by doing so attracts other defeated fighters. But when they gather they put their flag down and, consequently, their benefit and safety immediately vanish. Similarly, the Jews used to say that Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, prior to its revelation, would support them. When it was revealed however they denied it and Allah took away their light, i.e. their desire to believe and the benefit of such belief. This is because although they wanted to believe in Muhammad (pbuh) they did not do so, and consequently they were left them in the error of Judaism, unable to see guidance.</text>

      <text>(Or like a rainstorm from the sky). This is another simile, whereby the likeness of the hypocrites and Jews vis-"-vis the Qur'an is like rain that has poured down from heaven at night onto the wilderness, (wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash of lightening). Such is the Qur'an. For it has come down from Allah; it contains darkness as embodied in the exposition of seditions, thunderings of rebuke whereby fear is instilled, lightening of exposition, instruction and promise. (They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps) due to the sound of the thunder (for fear of death), for fear of misfortune and death. Similarly, the Jews and hypocrites used to put their fingers in their ears when they heard the Qur'an recited, delivering promises and threats like thunder-claps, and this they did for fear of death, i.e. for fear of being drawn to it. (And Allah encompasseth the disbelievers) and hypocrites, i.e. He knows them and will gather them in hell.</text>

      <text>(The lightning), i.e. fire, (almost snatcheth away their sight from them), i.e. from the unbelievers. Similarly, the exposition of the Qur'an almost snatched away their error. (As often as it flasheth forth), the lightening, (for them they walk therein) in the brightness of lightening, (and when it darkeneth against them they stand still) they remain in darkness. Likewise, when the hypocrites declared themselves to be believers, they went along with that which the believers went along with because their outward faith was accepted. But when they died, they remained in the darkness of the grave. (And if Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing), take away the thunder, (and their sight) the lightening. Likewise, if Allah willed, He could take away the hearing of the hypocrites and Jews through the rebukes and threats contained in the Qur'an, and He could also take away their sight through the exposition contained therein. (Indeed Allah is able to do all things) in terms of destroying their hearing and sight.</text>

(So do not set up rivals to Allah) do not say that Allah has peers, different forms or coequals (when you know) that He is the fashioner of all these things.

Allah disdaineth not), He cannot abstain from coining similes, and how can He disdain mentioning something that if all created being were to join forces to create, they would not be able to do so. Allah does not disdain (to coin the similitude) Allah does not disdain explaining to people a similitude (even of a gnat), even regarding a gnat, (or what is above it) let alone a simile of something greater than a gnat such as a fly, or a spider. (Those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (know that it), the simile, (is the Truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve), in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such similitude?) say: O Muhammad! What Allah wishes by such simile is that (He misleadeth many thereby) of the Jews from the true Religion, (and He guideth many thereby) of the believers, (and He misleadeth thereby), by such similes, (only miscreants), the Jews.</text>

This verse was revealed about a man who swore not to have sex with his wife for four months or longer.

(And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal) their pregnancy (that which Allah hath created in their wombs) of offspring (if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands would do better to take them back) to take them back as their wives (in that case) during the waiting period or if they are pregnant (if they desire reconciliation.) This is because in the early period of Islam, when a man divorced his wife via one or two pronouncements of divorce, he had a better right to take her back after the lapse of the waiting period, before her marrying again. Later, the right to take one's wife back was abrogated by the saying of Allah: (Divorce must be pronounced twice). Similarly, a man had a better right to take his wife back if she were pregnant, even if he had pronounced her divorce a thousand times. This was however abrogated by Allah's saying: (divorce them for their (legal) period) [65:1]. (And they (women) have rights) and inviolability with their husbands (similar to those) of their husbands (over them in kindness) in kind companionship and intercourse, (and men are a degree above them) in relation to the reasoning faculty, inheritance, blood money, as witnesses in court and also that which they owe them in terms of expenditure and service.

(And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wife both know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife.

This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry.

      <text>Allah then explained the creation of Jesus without a father because the delegation of Najran asked the Prophet to provide proof from the Qur'an for his saying that Jesus was not the son of Allah, so Allah said: (Lo! the likeness of Jesus) the likeness of the creation of Jesus (with Allah) without a father (is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust) without a father or mother, (then He said unto him) to Jesus: (Be! and he is) a son without a father.</text>

As response Allah said: (And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him) concerning Jesus, (after the knowledge which has come unto thee) after the exposition that has come to you that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner, (say (unto him): Come!

(There is no God save Allah) without a son or partner, (and lo! Allah is the Mighty) Who is vengeful against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) Who has commanded that none should be worshipped except Him; it is also said (the Wise) means: Allah ruled that they should go out and invoke His curse on those who lie, but the delegation of Najran refused to do so because they knew they were liars and that Muhammad was a true Prophet and emissary whose traits and description were to be found in their own Scripture.</text>

This was because they used to marry as many women as they liked, as many as nine or ten. Qays Ibn al-Harth for example had eight wives. Allah forbade them from doing so and prohibited them from marrying more than four wives, saying: (marry of the women, who seem good to you) marry that which Allah has made lawful for you, (two or three or four) marry one, two, three or four but do not marry more than four wives; (and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice) to four wives in relation to apportionment and providing sustenance (then one (only)) then marry only one free woman (or that your right hands possess) of captives, and in that case you do not owe them any apportionment, and they need not observe any waiting period.

This verse was revealed about Kabshah Bint Ma'an al-Ansariyyah and Muhsin Ibn Abi Qays al-Ansari; for before the advent of Islam, they used to inherit the women of their fathers (that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them) take away part of that which your fathers gave them, (unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness) unless they are guilty of fornication by the testimony of witnesses in which case they should be imprisoned. However, imprisoning fornicators was abrogated by the verse on stoning. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to inherit the wives of their fathers in the same way as they inherited their properties. The wife of a deceased father used to be inherited by the eldest son. If the woman was rich and beautiful, the eldest son would marry her without giving her any dowry. If, however, she was neither rich, young nor beautiful, he would not marry her but instead leave her untouched until she ransomed herself with her own money. Allah forbade them from indulging in such a practice. Then He showed them how one must treat women, saying: (But consort with them) keep their company (in kindness) with beneficence and goodness, (for if ye hate them) i.e. hate their company (it may happen that ye hate a thing) their company (wherein Allah hath placed much good) Allah may provide you with righteous children from them.</text>

(And if when they are honourably married) if when they marry maids (they commit lewdness) fornication (they) the maids (shall incur the half of the punishment (prescribed)) lashing (for free women (in that case).

      <text>(And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others) Allah says: a man should not covet the wealth, mount or wife of his brother nor, in fact, anything that his brother may possess. Rather you should ask of Allah abundant bounty and say: "O Allah provide us with the like of, or better than, what you have provided him with", while consigning the matter to Allah. It is also said that this verse was revealed about Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (pbuh) because she said to him: "if only it is prescribed unto us as it is prescribed unto men so that we get rewarded as men do". Allah prohibited such talk, saying: covet not the thing in which Allah has made a group of you excel over others, such as praying in congregation, attending the Friday Prayer, participating in military expeditions, jihad, enjoining good and forbidding evil. In this verse (some of you) and (others) refers to men and women. Allah then explained the reward that men and women earn for their works, saying: (Unto men a fortune) a reward (from that which they have earned) of works of goodness, (and unto women a fortune) a reward (from that which they have earned) of works of goodness in their homes. (But ask Allah of His bounty) Ask Allah to give you success and protection. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower of all things) good and bad, reward and punishment, success and otherwise.</text>

This group wanted to emigrate to Medina to see Allah's Messenger (pbuh) and declare their Islam. However, they were all killed and their belongings taken as booty. Hence, Allah explained the punishment of the people of the Banu Hilal, who were idolaters, saying: (The only reward) requital (of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger) of those who disbelieve in Allah and His messenger (and strive after corruption in the land) and engage in sin in the land, i.e. by wrongfully killing others and taking their properties (will be that they will be killed) He says: the punishment of one who kills and does not take the victim's property is that he be killed (or crucified) He says: the punishment of one who kills a person and also takes his property is that he be crucified, (or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off) the right hand and the left leg. He says: the punishment of one who takes another's property but does not kill is that his hand and leg be cut off, (or will be expelled out of the land) or he will be put in prison until he displays righteousness and his repentance becomes apparent. Allah says: the punishment of someone who terrorises people as a highway robber but does not kill or take anyone's property is that he be imprisoned. (Such) that which I have mentioned (will be their degradation) their punishment (in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom) more severe than their punishment which they suffered in this world, that is, if the person does not repent;</text>

(The expiation thereof) the expiation of the oath which is not unintentional (is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average of that wherewith ye feed your own folk) of bread and seasoning which you feed to them at lunch and dinner, (or the clothing of them) or the clothing of ten needy people whereby their nudity is covered: a shawl, a gown or a loin cloth, (or the liberation of a slave) whichever it is of these three options, (and for him who finds not (the wherewithal to do so)) any one of these three options (then a three day fast) consecutively.

      <text>(Allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of a Bahirah or a Sa'ibah or a Wasilah or a Hami) He says: Allah has not prohibited the Bahirah, the Sa'ibah, the Wasilah or the Hami. As for the Bahirah, it was the norm that if a she-camel delivered on its fifth birthing a male camel, the latter would be immolated and both men and women would eat from it, but if it were a female, they would cleave its ear. The latter is called a Bahirah. The latter's milk and benefits were for men only, to the exclusion of women, and when she died both men and women could share her meat. As for the Sa'ibah, people used to give whatever they were willing to give of cattle and hand it over to the custodians of idols. The latter would offer it to travellers who passed by, the men not the women. The animals offered were also male and never female. When these died both men and women shared its meat. As for the Wasilah, when a sheep had delivered seven times, they used to check the seventh birth. If it were male, they used to immolate it and its meat was shared by men and women. If it were female, women would not be allowed to benefit from it until the animal died. When the animal died, both men and women shared its meat. If it were a twin delivery, male and female, both were spared for the benefit of men only, until their death. When the animal died, both men and women shared their meat. As for the Ham, it is the male camel whose offspring has produced its own offspring, it is said that such an animal has protected its back. This animal is left alone: it is not used for riding or transporting things. It cannot be stopped from drinking of any water or grazing in any pasture, nor can it be stopped from copulating with any she-camel that comes its way. When this animal gets too old or dies, its meat is shared by men and women. Allah says that He did not prescribe any of these practices described above; (but those who disbelieve) i.e. 'Amr ibn Luhayy and his followers (invent a lie against Allah) by declaring the above unlawful [for some]. (Most of them) all of them (have no sense) in relation to Allah's command, that which He has made lawful and that which He has made unlawful.</text>

Then, leaving the question in the case of settlement, Allah mentioned the same question in the case of travelling, saying: (in case you are campaigning in the land) if you are out in the land or travelling (and the calamity of death befall you). This verse was revealed about three men who travelled together for trade to Historic Syria. On the way, one of them, Budayl Ibn Abi Mariyah, a client of 'Amr Ibn al-'As, who was a Muslim, died. But before he died, he requested his two companions, 'Adiyy Ibn Bida' and Tamim Ibn Aws al-Dari, who were Christians, to hand over his property to his people. They however betrayed his testament. So Allah said to the custodians of the deceased person: (You shall empanel them both) the two Christians (after the prayer) of 'Asr, (and, if ye doubt) O custodian of the deceased person that they gave back less than the deceased person had with him, (they shall be made to swear by Allah (saying): We will not take a bribe) let them say: we will not exchange our oath for a paltry portion of this world, (even though it were (on behalf of) a near kinsman) even if the deceased person is one of our kinsmen (nor will we hide the testimony of Allah) let them also say: we will not withhold our testimony, if asked, (for then) for if we withhold our testimony (indeed we should be of the sinful) i.e. of the wrong-doers.</text>

I too am working) to destroy you. (Thus ye will come to know for which of us will be the happy sequel) i.e. Paradise.

(He will reward them) this is a threat to them (for their attribution (ordinances unto Him)) it is also said that this means: He will reward them with what will happen to them.

So Allah said: (Say) O Muhammad: (I find not in that which is revealed unto me) i.e. the Qur'an (aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh for that verily is foul) unlawful (or the abomination) an immolated animal (which was immolated to the name of other than Allah) intentionally. (But whoso is compelled (thereto)) whoever is forced to eat the meat of carrion, (neither craving) i.e. without infringement on Muslims nor deeming the meat of carrion lawful in other than necessity (nor transgressing) nor committing highway robbery or intentionally eating of the meat of carrion without being compelled to do so, ((for him) lo! your Lord is Forgiving) if he eats to satiety, (Merciful) in that which He made dispensation for him. However, he ought not to eat to satiety, and if he does, Allah will pardon him.</text>

      <text>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding Allah's saying: (Freedom from obligation): '(Freedom from obligation) this is freedom from obligation (from Allah and His messenger towards those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty) but then they broke that treaty; freedom from obligation is the breaking of treaties. Allah says: whosoever has a treaty with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) let him know that it is broken. Some of them had a treaty lasting four months, and some of more nine months, while others had treaties for longer or shorter periods. Others had no treaty with Allah's Messenger at all. All these treaties were broken except for the treaty with the Banu Kinanah which was for nine months. Whoever had a treaty for more or less than four months, their treaties were ratified to last four month beginning from the day of immolation; and whoever had a treaty of four months, that treaty was ratified to last four months beginning from the day of immolation. Those who had a treaty of nine months, their treaties were left as they were, while those who did not sign any treaty, were granted one of 50 days beginning from the day of immolation until the departure of the person who was in a state of ritual consecration:</text>

Joseph said: "You have seen an evil thing. As for your going out of the King's kitchen, this means that you will lose your job; the three baskets means that you will stay in prison for three days.

So they said: "O Muhammad! When will the torment which you promised us happen?" As a response, Allah revealed: (The commandment of Allah will come to pass) the chastisement of Allah has come. The Prophet (pbuh) was sitting at that point and he suddenly stood, having no doubt in his mind that the chastisement had come. But immediately after that, Allah said: (so seek not ye to hasten it) i.e. the chastisement, at which the Prophet (pbuh) sat down.

His are the most beautiful names) the most sublime attributes such as knowledge, power, hearing, sight; so call Him by using them. (And thou (Muhammad), be not loud voiced in thy worship) do not be too loud in your recitation of the Qur'an during prayer so that the idolaters do not harm you (nor yet silent therein) such that your Companions cannot hear you, (but follow a way between) a middle ground between loud and silent recitation.</text>

He said: " Take with you salted fish and walk along the sea shores until you find a rock in which there is the fountain of life. Sprinkle some of the water on the fish until it comes back to life. There you will meet Khidr ". Allah said: (And when Moses said unto his servant) his servant was Shajardah Joshua ben Nun, an Israelite nobleman. He was his servant in the sense that he kept his company and served him: (I will not give up until I reach the point where the two rivers meet) where sea water meets with river water, i.e. where the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea meet, (though I march on for ages) or I will continue going on for years.</text>

      <text>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of (Kaf. Ha. Ya. Ain. Sad): '(Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ayn. Sad.) this is an expression of praise with which Allah praised Himself. He says: Kaf means He is Sufficient (Kafi), Ha means He is the guiding One (Hadi), 'Ayn means He is Possessor of knowledge ('Alim), and Sad means He is Possessor of Truth (Sadiq); it is also said that Kaf means He is Sufficient unto His servants, Ha means He guides His servants, Ya means His hand is above His creation, and 'Ayn means He knows the affairs of His servants, and Sad means He is true in His promise. It is also said that Kaf is from the Generous (Karim), Ha is from the One who guides (Hadi), Ya is from Clement (Halim), 'Ayn from the One who possesses knowledge ('Alim), and Sad from the Truthful (Sadiq), or from the Veracious (Sudduq). It is also said that (Kaf. Ha. Ya. Ain. Sad) is an oath by means of which Allah swore.</text>

(Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you) do you not want, O Abu Bakr, that Allah forgive you? (Allah is Forgiving, Merciful) towards the person who repents. When he heard this, Abu Bakr said: " I do indeed, O my Lord! " and so after the revelation of this verse, he showed kindness to his relatives and helped them financially.</text>

      <text>Then the following was revealed when 'Umar said: " I wish that Allah forbids our children and servants from entering in on us except with permission at three times when we are likely to be exposed ": (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Let your slaves) young slaves, (and those of you who have not come to puberty) among those who are not slaves, (ask leave of you) to enter in on you (at three times: Before the prayer of dawn) from the time of dawn until the beginning of Fajr prayer, (and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon) for the time of the siesta until the prayer of Zuhr, (and after the prayer of night) and after the 'Isha' prayer to the break of dawn. (Three times of privacy for you). Then Allah gave them dispensation to enter without permission, saying: (It is no sin for them) for the children or young slaves, excepting from this older slaves, (or for you) for the masters of the house (at other times) other than those three times of privacy, (when some of you go round) to serve (attendant upon others) you and them can enter in on each other without permission. As for older children and older slaves they have to ask permission at all times before entering in on their parents or masters.

      <text>(O ye who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a meal) this verse was revealed concerning a group of believers who used to enter the rooms of the Prophet (pbuh) in the morning and evening and wait for the food to be served. They used to eat and speak with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet (pbuh) did not like this but felt shy of these believers and could not tell them to stop coming to his rooms without permission, or ask them to leave once they were inside. But Allah forbade them from this, saying: O believers, do not enter the rooms of the Prophet (pbuh) without permission from the Prophet to come and eat (without waiting for the proper time) for the food to be ready, (unless permission be granted you) to come in. (But if ye are invited, enter, and, when, your meal is ended) when you have finished eating, (then disperse) then leave. (Linger not for conversation) with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! That) coming in, sitting down and having conversation with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) (would cause annoyance to the Prophet) Allah bless him and give him peace, (and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go)) or not to come in the first place; (but Allah is not shy of the Truth) Allah is not shy to command you to leave and not go in his rooms without his permission. (And when ye ask of them (the wives of the Prophet) anything) and when you speak with them, (ask it of them) speak with them (from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts) i.e. from doubts. (And it is not for you to cause annoyance to the Messenger of Allah) by entering his rooms without his permission and conversing with his wives, (nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him) after his death. This verse was revealed about Talhah Ibn 'Ubaydullah who had in mind to marry 'A'ishah after the death of the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo!

      <text>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said upon the interpretation of Allah's saying (Sad.): '(Sad.) He says: Sad by the Qur'an, i.e. repeat the Qur'an until you distinguish between faith and disbelief, the prophetic wont and blameworthy innovation, truthfulness and lying, the lawful and the unlawful, good and evil; it is also said that Sad stands for barring (sadd) from the guidance, i.e. the barring of the people of Mecca from the Truth and guidance; it is also said that it stands for Abu Jahl; and it is also said that it stands for truthful (sadiq) in his speech; and it is also said that Sad is one of Allah's names; and it is also said that it is an oath by which Allah swore (By the renowned Qur'an) by the Qur'an which possesses honour and clarity of exposition; it is an honour to those who believe in it and it is a clear exposition of the people of old as well as of future generations of people.

And they stopped until Allah destroyed all of them. This is because before this, upon fighting an enemy, they used to say: attack all together! (Manas! Manas!). Some would therefore survive and others die. But when they were defeated by the enemy they used to cry: flee! Flee! (Manasa! Manasa!), and so they used to flee all together from the battlefield. These were two different signs whenever they engaged in fighting either to attack or to flee from the enemy. When Allah wished to destroy them, the angels cried out to them: this is no context for attacking or fleeing.</text>

Allah said: (Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad)) on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyah, (swear allegiance only unto Allah) it is as if they swear allegiance to Allah.

None of those who swore allegiance broke his oath, because they were all sincere and died honouring the allegiance of Ridwan.

(Lo! Allah loveth the equitable) Allah loves those who judge justly by the Book of Allah, and act upon it.</text>

      <text>(O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk) this was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who mentioned a man of the Helpers with something bad; he mentioned the man's mother about whom he used to taunted in the pre-Islamic period, but Allah forbade him from saying ill things about fellow believers, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; referring here specifically to Thabit! (Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they (are)) in the sight of Allah and also better in the share they have with Him, (nor let women (deride) women) this was revealed about two of the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) who derided Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet, and Allah forbade them from doing so (who may be better than they are) in the sight of Allah and also better in the share they have with Him; (neither defame one another) do not defame your believing brothers nor backbite against each other, (nor insult one another by nicknames) which were used in the pre-Islamic period. (Bad is the name of lewdness) it is bad to call your brother: "O Jew", "O Christian", "O Magian" (after faith) after having accepted faith and turned his back on all that. (And whoso turneth not in repentance) from calling his brothers with such names and nicknames after having accepted faith, (such are evil-doers) such are those who harm themselves with punishment. This was revealed about Abu Burdah Ibn Malik al-Ansari and 'Abdullah Ibn Hadrad al-Aslami who had a dispute and Allah forbade them from doing so.</text>

      <text>(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Shun much suspicion) this was revealed about two Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who backbit Salman al-Farisi and also thought ill of Usamah, the Servant of Allah's Messenger (pbuh). They spied on him to see whether Usamah did really have what the Prophet (pbuh) asked him to give to them. Allah therefore forbade them from having a bad opinion about others, as well as from suspicion and spying; and so He said: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, shun much suspicion about your brother's ins and outs (for lo! some suspicion is a crime) for some ill thoughts and what you hide are sins; this is what the two men thought of Usamah. (And spy not) and do not scrutinise the faults of your brother, nor reveal that which Allah has concealed about him; and this is exactly what the two men did, (neither backbite one another) the two backbit Salman. (Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother) unlawfully without any necessity? (Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)) you deem eating the flesh of a carrion unlawful unless it is out of necessity, consider backbiting your brother likewise! (And keep your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding backbiting anyone. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) Allah forgives whoever repents of backbiting, (Merciful) towards whoever die repentant.</text>

This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who said to a man: "You are the son of so-and-so" in reference to his mother; and it is also said that it was revealed about Bilal the muezzin of the Prophet (pbuh). When Bilal gave the call to prayer in Mecca after its conquest, a group of men from Quraysh, among whom were Sahl Ibn 'Amr, al-Harth Ibn Hisham and Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, said: "Did Allah and His Messenger not find anyone to call to prayer except this raven". In response, Allah said: (Lo! We have created you male and female) from Adam and Eve, (and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you) in the Hereafter, (in the sight of Allah) on the Day of Judgement, (is the best in conduct) in the life of the world; which in this case is Bilal. (Lo!

      <text>(The wandering Arabs say: We believe) this was revealed about Banu Asad who had suffered a very hard year and consequently joined Islam and moved with all their families and children to Medina to benefit from the Prophet's donations. But their presence in Medina caused a rise in the price of foodstuffs and the streets of Medina became full of their impurities. In fact, these people were hypocrites who kept reiterating: "O Messenger of Allah! We are true believers, so do feed us and be generous with us". When Allah mentioned their claim, the wandering Arabs of Banu Asad said: "We are genuine in our faith in Allah and His Messenger". But Allah said: (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Ye believe not) you are not genuine in your faith in Allah and His Messenger, (but rather say "We submit") we submit so that we may be spared from the sword and captivity, (for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts) for love and sincerity of faith have not entered your hearts. (Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger) inwardly as you obey him outwardly and repent of inward disbelief and hypocrisy, (He will not withhold from you aught of (the reward of) your deeds) He will not diminish the reward of your works.

      <text>Allah then showed their works in the life of the world, saying: (Those who avoid enormities of sin) i.e. idolatry and the major sins (and abominations) adultery and transgressions, (save the unwilled offences) except a furtive look, a taunt, a censure which they then blame themselves for committing and repent of doing; it is also said that this means: except marrying ((for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy) towards he who repents of major and minor sins. (He is best aware of you) than your own selves (when He created you from the earth) He created you from Adam and Adam is from dust and dust is from the earth, (and when ye were) small (hidden in the bellies of your mothers) Allah knew in these circumstances what will ensue from you. (Therefore ascribe not purity unto yourselves) do not absolve yourselves from committing sins. (He is best aware of him who wardeth off (evil)) transgression and does good.</text>

This verse was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan who was of the habit of spending a great deal on, and gives alms to, the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) but then he met 'Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh. The latter said to him: " I see that you spend a great deal on these, and I fear that you may be left with nothing ". 'Uthman said to him: " I have faults and sins which I want to expiate and I also want to obtain Allah's good pleasure ". 'Abdullah said: " Give me the halter of your camel and I will bear your sins and faults in this life and in the Hereafter ". As a result, he gave him the halter of his camel and confided himself to spending on him. It is because of this that this verse was revealed.</text>

      <text>Allah explained the expiation for saying to one's wife: "you are unlawful to me just like my mother is" (Zihar), saying: (Those who put away their wives (by saying they are as their mothers)) those who make unlawful for themselves sexual intercourse with their wives (and afterward would go back on that which they have said) then go back on making it lawful; ((the penalty) in that case (is) the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this) freeing of a slave (ye are exhorted) as an expiation of the Zihar; (and Allah is informed of what ye do) regarding the Zihar, of expiation and other things.</text>

(This) which I have explained regarding the expiation of the Zihar, (that ye may put trust in Allah and His messenger) in order that you acknowledge the obligations of Allah and the wont of His Messenger. (Such are the limits (imposed by Allah)) such are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah regarding the Zihar; (and for disbelievers) in the limits imposed by Allah (is a painful doom) whose pain will extend to their hearts. From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik al-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: "You should free a slave". Aws said: "I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave". The Prophet (pbuh) said: "Then you should fast two successive months". Aws said: "I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast". The Prophet (pbuh) said: "Then you should feed 60 needy ones". Aws said: "I can not afford it". The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: "I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I". The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to his wife whom he had declared unlawful for himself.</text>

This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose story is mentioned in the Surah of the Private Apartments. It is also said it was revealed about a group of people from Badr, among whom were Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas. These people went to the Prophet (pbuh) on a Friday when he was staying in the apartment of his wife Safiyyah. When they could not find a place where to sit, they stood at the beginning of the assembly. So the Prophet (pbuh) addressed some people who were not among those who participated in the Battle of Badr: so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so let those who took part in the Battle of Badr sit in your places. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour all those who fought at the battle of Badr. But when he did that, he noticed that those who were made to give up their seats resented it, and so Allah revealed about them this verse. (And when it is said, Come up higher!) in prayer, jihad or remembrance (go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe) in secret and openly (among you) in ranks, (and those who have knowledge) along with faith, (to high ranks) merits in Paradise, more than the merits given to those who have faith but have no knowledge.

This was revealed about those believers who were well off and used to speak to the Prophet (pbuh) more than the poor believers, so much so that they vexed both the Prophet (pbuh) and the poor believers. Allah, therefore, forbade them from doing so and commanded them to give alms to the poor, one silver coin for each word they would say to him, before they even spoke with the Prophet (pbuh). (That) almsgiving (is better) than holding back money (and purer for you) and purer for your hearts from sins; and it is also said this means: it is purer for the hearts of the poor in that it prevents their hearts from becoming hard.

(Then, when ye do it not) when you do not give alms (and Allah hath forgiven you) the question of giving alms, (establish worship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and obey Allah) in that which He commands you (and His messenger) in that which he commands you.

When believing women) who truly believe in Allah (come unto you as fugitives) from Mecca to Medina or al-Hudaybiyyah, (examine them) ask them and let them swear as to their intentions from their coming. (Allah is best aware of their faith) Allah is best aware of their hearts' firmness in faith. (Then, if ye know them for true believers) through examination, (send them not back unto the disbelievers) do not send them back to their disbelieving husbands. (They are not) i.e. the believing women, (lawful for the disbelievers) for their disbelieving husbands, (nor are the disbelievers lawful for them) for the believing women. Allah says: a believing woman is not lawful for a disbelieving man nor is a disbelieving woman lawful for a believing man. (And give the disbelievers that which they have spent (upon them)) give their husbands that which they have spent on them as dower. This was revealed about Subay'ah Bint al-Harth al-Aslamiyyah who came to the Prophet (pbuh) in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, to declare her Islam but her husband Musafir came after her to take her back. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give peace, gave him back the dowry which her husband had given her. In that particular year, and before the revelation of this verse, the people of Mecca had signed a treaty with the Prophet (pbuh) which stipulated that whoever from the people of Mecca embraces Islam can join the Muslims, and whoever of the Muslims embraces the religion of the Meccan pagans is returned to the Muslims; and any woman from the people of Mecca who embraces Islam, the Muslims should pay back the dowry given to her to her husband, and any Muslim woman who joins the religion of the Meccan pagans, the people of Mecca should pay back her dowry to her husband. This is why the Prophet (pbuh) paid back to Musafir the dowry which he had given to Subay'ah. (And it is no sin for you) O believers (to marry such women) those who were disbelievers and then embraced Islam (when ye have given them their dues) when you have given them their dowry. Allah says here: any woman who embraces Islam while her husband remains a disbeliever, the sacred bond that ties her to her husband becomes broken and, therefore, she does not have to observe a waiting period and can marry after making sure she is not pregnant.</text>

There were just six women who left Islam and joined the disbelievers of Mecca, two of them were wives of 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab, Umm Salamah and Umm Kulthum Bint Jarul, and also Umm al-Hakam the daughter of Abu Sufyan who was the wife of 'Abbad Ibn Shaddad al-Fihri, and Fatimah Bint Abi Umayyah Ibn al-Mughirah and Buru' Bint 'Uqbah who was the wife of Shammas Ibn 'Uthman from the Banu Makhzum, and 'Abdah Bint 'Abd al-'Uzza Ibn Nadlah whose husband was 'Amr Ibn Wudd, and Hind Bint Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham whose husband was Hashim Ibn al-'Ass Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi.

Allah answered by saying (Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger, and should strive for the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives"), and so Allah explained to them what to do, saying: you should be firm in your belief in Allah and His Messenger and you should also strive to obey Allah using your wealth and own persons.

      <text>And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying (O Prophet!): '(O Prophet!) And this includes his community. (When ye (men) put away women) He says: tell your people, when you want to divorce women, (put them away for their (legal) period) divorce them when they become pure from their menses and they have not had sexual intercourse with them (and reckon the period) reckon their periods of purity following three periods of menstruation which are followed by major ritual ablution which, for this denotes the end of the waiting period (and keep your duty to Allah) and fear Allah, (your Lord) and do not divorce them when they are not ritually pure, as this goes against the prophetic practice. (Expel them not from their houses) where the divorce has taken place until the waiting period is over (nor let them go forth) until the elapse of the waiting period (unless they commit open immorality) unless they commit an evident sin, i.e. going out during the waiting period without her husbands' permission. Thus, expelling them from their homes during the waiting period is a sin and their going out in their waiting period is also a sin; it is also said that (unless they commit open immorality) means: unless they commit an act of adultery witnessed by four people, in which case they should be stoned. (Such are the limits (imposed by) Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah about women regarding expenditure and lodgement; (and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) and whoever transgresses Allah's legal rulings and obligations and that which He has commanded regarding expenditure and lodgement, (he verily wrongeth his soul) he harms his own person. (Thou knowest not) i.e. the husband does not know: (it may be that Allah will afterward) after the first pronouncement of divorce and before the end of the waiting period (bring some new thing to pass) i.e. love between the husband and wife and return to each other.</text>
