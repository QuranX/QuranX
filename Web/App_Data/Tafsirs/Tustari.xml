      <text>Praise be to God Sahl said:The meaning of "Praise be to God" (al-ḥamdu li"Llāh) is "thanks be to God" (al-shukru li"Llāh), [for] gratitude towards God is obedience (ṭāʿa) to Him. Obedience to Him is guardianship (wilāya) from Him, Exalted is He, and thus God, Exalted is He, has said: "Your patron (walī) is God only, and His Messenger, and the believers..." [5:55] God"s patronage can only be fully attained by becoming free of all other than Him.The meaning of Lord of the Worlds is: the Lord of all created beings and the One who rears and fosters them (murabbī); He is the One who presides over their affairs and who rectifies and orders things for them, even before they and their acts are brought into existence. He deals with them according to His pre-eternal knowledge of them, as He wills and for whatever purpose He wills, wishes, rules, and decrees, regarding that which is commanded and that which is forbidden, and they have no lord except Him.</text>

      <text>You [alone] we worship",That is, we submit to, and humble ourselves before, You alone. We recognise Your lordship and we affirm Your oneness, and You do we serve. From this word (naʿbudu) is derived the word ʿabd meaning "servant". "And You [alone] we ask for help, that is, in what You have charged us with, which is [rightfully] Yours, [and over which] You exercise Your will (mashīʾa) and volition (irāda). Moreover, knowledge and sincerity are due only to You. We are incapable of [accomplishing that with which You have charged us] except through aid (maʿūna) and steadfastness (tasdīd) that come from You, for there is no power or strength except that which comes from You.</text>

      <text>Guide us to the straight path. He [Sahl] was asked, "Has not God already guided us to the straight path?" He replied:That is so, but this refers to seeking more from Him, as He has said: and with Us there is yet more [50:35]. [Thus] what is meant by His words Guide us is: "Support us with Your aid (maʿūna) and empowerment (tamkīn)".On another occasion he said that Guide us (ihdinā) means:Guide us (arshidnā) to the religion of Islam, which is the way to You, through assistance from You, which is insight (baṣīra), for we cannot be guided except through You, just as he [Moses] said: "Perhaps my Lord will show me the right way" [28:22], that is, "Guide me to pursue the path that leads to Him".I heard Sahl relate on the authority of Muḥammad b. Sawwār from Sufyān, who heard it from Salīm, who was told by Abū al-Jaʿd from Thawbān, who narrated that the Messenger of God said:God says: "I have divided the prayer between Me and My servant into two halves. Half of it is for Me and the other half is for My servant, and My servant gets what he asks for." Thus, when the servant says, Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, God, Exalted is He, says, "My servant has praised and thanked Me." When he says, the Merciful, the Compassionate, [God says], "My servant has extolled Me". And when he says, Master of the Day of Judgement, [God says], "My servant has glorified Me. These verses are for Me and for My servant is what he asks for [in the verses that come] after, as when he says, You [alone] we worship, and You [alone] do we ask for help.! Guide us to the straight path, until the end of the sūra." God, Mighty and Majestic is He, says: "These verses are for My servant and My servant shall receive what he asks for." Sahl said:The meaning of "My servant has glorified Me" here is: "He has attributed abundant beneficence (iḥsān) and munificence (inʿām) to Me".Sahl related on the authority of Mujāhid:Āmīn is one of the names of God, Exalted is He. Ibn ʿAbbās y said, "The Christians have never envied you anything as much as your saying Āmīn.</text>

      <text>Alif Lām MīmSahl said:Alif Lām Mīm is a name of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and within it are meanings and attributes that people of understanding (fahm) know, not to mention the many meanings that it holds for the people of outward [knowledge]. If these letters are read separately, Alif stands for God"s assembling [things in their creation] (taʾlīf), Mighty and Majestic is He, for He brought together all things as He willed. The Lām stands for His pre-eternal grace (luṭfuhu al-qadīm) and the Mīm stands for His great glory (majduhu al-ʿaẓīm).Sahl said:Each book that God, Exalted is He, sent down contains a secret, and the secret of the Qurʾān is contained within the letters which open the sūras, because they are names and attributes, such as when He says Alif Lām Mīm [2:1; 3:1; 29:1 and 31:1], Ṣād [38:1], Alif Lām Rā [10:1; 11:1; 13:1; 14:1 and 15:1], Kāf Ḥā Yā ʿAyn Ṣād [19:1], Tā Sīn Mīm [26:1 and 28:1], Ḥā Mīm [41:1], ʿAyn Sīn Qāf. When these letters are brought together they make up the Greatest Name of God " that is, if a letter is taken from each [group] of the opening letters of the sūras, one after the other in the order that the sūras were revealed, that is, Alif Lām Rā, Ḥā Mīm, and Nūn, they form the divine name al-Raḥmān." Ibn ʿAbbās and Ḍaḥḥāk, on the other hand, said that Alif Lām Mīm means "I am God and I know"; while ʿAlī said that these are names [in the form of] "disconnected" [letters], but if a letter is taken from each of the opening groups of letters, on the condition that it is not the same as the letter adjacent to it, and then they are assembled, they form one of the names of the Merciful. If this name is known and used in supplication, it will be the mightiest name by which the prayer of the supplicant who uses it will be answered.Sahl said:In the words Alif Lām Mīm,! That Book [2:1"2], Alif stands for God (Allāh), Lām stands for the servant (ʿabd), and Mīm stands for Muḥammad.</text>

      <text>"In it there is no doubt (rayb)"This means that there is no uncertainty (shakk) in it. A guidance for those who are mindful of God (muttaqūn) " that is, an explanation (bayān) for those who are mindful of God. The mindful of God are those who have freed themselves from the claim of possessing any power or strength except in God, Exalted is He, and who have resorted to taking refuge [in Him] and depending solely on His power and strength in every situation. So God has assisted them and provided for them whence they had no reckoning, and made for them a source of relief and release from the trials to which He has subjected them.Sahl [further] said:God"s power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa) are [manifest in] His act, His act is according to His knowledge, and His knowledge is among the attributes belonging to His essence. The power and strength of the servant are but a temporary claim which lasts only until the last hour. The last hour is in the possession of God alone, Exalted is He.</text>

      <text>The [ones who are] mindful of God are those who believe in the unseen"God is the unseen and His religion is the unseen, and God, Mighty and Majestic is He, has ordered them to believe in the unseen, to free themselves from [any claim] to power and strength concerning that which they have been commanded to do and prohibited from doing, in faith, speech and action and to say, "We have no power (ḥawl) to keep ourselves from disobediencesave through Your protection (ʿiṣma), and we have no strength (quwwa) to obey You save through Your aid (maʿūna)." This is [a result of] of His compassion (ishfāq) towards them, and of His assisting them so that they do not claim power, strength and ability as did those who were damned from pre-eternity. When [these latter] saw the punishment with their own eyes, they disowned [their claim], but their disavowal did not avail them after they had actually seen the punishment. God has informed us about those who fit this description in His words But their faith was of no benefit to them when they (actually) saw Our punishment [40:85], and: Their only plea when Our might came upon them, was to say, "We were evildoers indeed" [7:5]. Similarly, Pharaoh claimed to have power, strength and ability, and said, "Whenever I wish to believe, I will believe", but when he actually came to believe it was not accepted from him, as God, Exalted is He, said, Now " when hitherto you have disobeyed and been of those who do corruption? [10:91]</text>
      <text>"And spend out of what We have provided them:Sahl said:Truly God, Exalted is He, has described in this way those whom He has moulded with a certain nature, who are connected to Him by a certain link, and who never lapse in their heedfulness (murāqaba) of Him. They are those who never made a choice and desired nothing other than Him. Their only choice is that He should choose for them, even as He has chosen them for Himself. They desire nothing that has any relation to another which will remove them from their dependence solely on Him, for they have freed themselves from other than Him.Abū Bakr relates that it was said to Sahl: "Truly God has granted you wisdom (ḥikma)", to which he replied:Indeed, God willing, I have been granted wisdom (ḥikma) and [a knowledge of] the unseen (ghayb) which I was taught from the unseen of His secret (min ghayb sirrihi), and thus He sufficed me from the need for all other knowledge " and that the ultimate end is toward your Lord [53:42], and He completed what He had begun with me out of His grace and beneficence.His words, Mighty and Majestic is He:</text>

      <text>Those are upon guidance from their Lord"That is, a clear explanation (bayān) from their Lord: by the light of His guidance hearts witness Him in confident abandonment to Him due to a light from His light, by which He singled them out in His prior knowledge. They do not speak except with guidance (hudā), and their inner perception is solely directed towards that guidance. So those who are guided by [this light] are never left by it; they are [constant] witnesses to it because they are never absent from it. If people were to ask them about it they would inform them, and if they were to will [something], it would quickly be brought about. Thus "they are the ones who will prosper [2:5], and they are directed to guidance and success through His guidance. [It is they who will] remain (bāqūna) in Paradise with the permanent subsistence (baqāʾ) of God, Mighty and Majestic is He. Then Sahl said:It was transmitted to me that God, Exalted is He, revealed to David the words: "Make sure that I do not pass you by, for in that case you would forgo everything. Verily I created Muḥammad for My sake, and I created Adam for his sake. I created My believing servantsfor My worship, and I created all other things for [the service of] the son of Adam. So if he preoccupies himself with that which I have created for his service, I will veil him from that [for] which I created [him] for My sake."</text>

      <text>"So set not up compeers (andād) to God"That is, adversaries (aḍdād), and the greatest adversary is the self that incites to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi"l-sūʾ), which is only bent on its own pleasures (ḥuẓūẓ) and cravings (munā), without having any regard for guidance from God. Sahl was asked about God"s words:</text>

      <text>"They shall be given it [the fruits] in perfect semblance; "and there for them shall be spouses, purified",He replied:In Paradise there are no carpets, vessels, clothes, perfume, birds or plants, nor any fruits [as we know them]. Thus the semblance that the things of this world bear to those [mentioned in the verse] is no more than a coincidence in their names. So the pomegranate of this world does not in the least resemble the pomegranate in Paradise, except in name. The same is the case with resemblance of the date, the jujube and other such fruits [to those of Paradise]. What is intended in His saying in [perfect] semblance is only a likeness in colour, for there is a differencein taste. When in Paradise the angels bring an apple to the friends of God (awliyāʾ) during the day, and then they bring them another during the night, and they ask, "Is this one [like the other]?" They are told, "Taste it", and on tasting it they experience a different taste to that of the first one. It should not be discounted from God"s ability, Exalted is He, that He could make an apple taste like a pomegranate, almond or quince."Sahl continued:Indeed I know one of the friends of God (awliyāʾ) who saw on the seashore a man who had before him the biggest pomegranate that there ever was. The friend of God (walī) asked him what he had before him, to which he replied, "It is a pomegranate that I saw in Paradise. I desired it so God granted it to me, but when He placed it before me I regretted my haste for having it while still in this world." That man [the walī] asked, "May I eat some of it?" and the man responded, "If you have the capacity to eat it, then do so"; upon which he grabbed the fruit from him and ate most of it. When the man saw him eating the fruit he it was astounded and said, "Receive glad tidings of Paradise, for I did not know your [spiritual] rank before you ate it; no one eats of the food of Paradise in this life except the people of Paradise."Then Abū Bakr asked Sahl if the one who had eaten the pomegranate had informed him of its taste, to which he replied:He did, and its taste brings together the tastes of all fruits, and in addition it has a smoothness and coolness which is unlike any of the tastes [experienced] in this world.Then Abū Bakr commented, "I have no doubt, nor does anyone who heard this story from Sahl, that he himself was in fact both the possessor of that pomegranate and the one who ate it."Sahl was asked about His words:</text>

      <text>"I am appointing on earth a vicegerent"He answered:God, Exalted is He, before he created Adam said to the angels I am appointing on earth a vicegerent, and He created Adam from the clay of might consisting of the light of Muḥammad, and He informed him that his self which incites evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi"l-sūʾ) would be his worst enemy, and that He had created it so that he conduct it [on the path] to Him, accordingto his knowledge of it, regarding notions (khawāṭir) and impulses (himam) [which arise in it], and that he [Adam] conduct it in such a way as to remain utterly dependent on Him, seeking refuge in Him. If He shows it an act of obedience, it should respond by saying, "O help me!", and if it is moved to an act of disobedience, it should cry out, "O protect me!" If it is moved to a blessing, it should say, "Grant me a share of it!" If He says to it, "Be patient in the face of tribulation", it should respond saying, "O, grant me patience!" His [man"s] heart should not entertain the slightest whispering (waswasa) of the self without abandoning it and returningto its Lord. God, Exalted is He, made the natural propensity (ṭabʿ) of the self such that it is passive when faced with commandments and active when faced with prohibitions. However, He commanded it to respond with passivity when inclined to activity, and to be active when inclined to passivity, with the words, "There is neither power nor strength except in God", that is, there is no power to resist disobeying Him except through His protection, and no strength to obey Him except with His aid.Then He ordered him [Adam] to enter the Garden and eat from it at ease wherever he wished, after which He decreed to him that he may not eat from the Tree. When he entered the Garden and saw what he saw there, he said, "If only we could stay here forever; yet, indeed, we have an appointed time that extends to a known limit.</text>

      <text>Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord, and He relented towards him...Sahl was asked, "What were the words that Adam learnt from his Lord?" He replied:Muḥammad b. Sawwār informed me, [in a narration] from his father, from al-Thawrī, from ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz b. Rafīʿ, on the authority of ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar y, that he [the latter] said: "When Adam recalled his error he said: "O Lord, do you see the act of disobedience by which I disobeyed You as something that You preordained for me before You created me, or somethingthat I initiated?" He replied: "Indeed, it is something that I preordained for you, that you would do as a consequence of My lifting My protection from you, fifty thousand years before creating you." Then Adam asked, "As you preordained it for me, then forgive me, for indeed We have wronged our own souls [7:23], through carrying out the lower self"s desire and relying on its devising, and we have repented from ever going back to that. If You do not forgive us " that is, in this life, and have mercy upon us, during what remains of our lives we shall surely be among the lost [7:23] " that is, among the damned and tormented in the Hereafter.""So these were the words which God, Exalted is He, was speaking about when He said: Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord, and his Lord relented towards him, truly He is the Relenting, the Merciful.It was related from the Prophet that he said: "Adam asked Moses, (peace be upon them both), "How many years before my creation do you find that my sin was destined for me?" He replied, "Forty thousand years."" The Prophet then said, "Thus did Adam confute Moses (peace be upon them both)." Sahl was asked about God"s words:</text>
      <text>[2:30]"Whilst we glorify You with praise and sanctify You"It means "We purify ourselves for Your sake by saying what You inspired us to say through the favour that You bestowed upon us. Blessed are You, O our Lord!"</text>

      <text>"And be in awe of Me.Sahl was asked, "What is this awe (rahba) that He commanded them to feel towards Him?" He replied:He meant by this, the [true] locating of the light of certainty (mawḍiʿ nūr al-yaqīn) in relationto the heart"s insight (baṣar al-qalb), and gnosis (maʿrifa) in relation to the entirety of the heart (kulliyat al-qalb). For endurance (mukābada) and struggle (mujāhada) are a part of faith ⸢for the sake of God (īmān li"Llāh)⸣. Then, when the heart ceases to have fear of all other than Him, the light of certainty is unveiled, and the servant who abides in faith for the sake of God, attains ⸢to faith in [or through] God (īmān bi"Llāh)⸣, with an unshakeable realisationof His oneness (tawḥīdan ʿalā tamkīn), by which I mean, his heart is in a state of tranquil and confident repose with his Master (sukūn qalbihi ilā mawlāhu). Consequently, the light of certainty unveils the knowledge of the eye of certainty (ʿilm ʿayn al-yaqīn), and this is the attainment (wuṣūl) of God, Exalted is He. For this certainty, by virtue of the light of certainty (bi-nūr al-yaqīn) that leads to the eye of certainty, is not ⸢something that is brought into being (mukawwan)⸣, nor is it something created (makhlūq); rather it is a light from the light of the essence of God (dhāt al-Ḥaqq), not in the sense of an indwelling (ḥulūl), nor of conjoining (jamʿ), or conjunction (ittiṣāl). Rather, the meaning of the servant"s attainment (ittiṣāl) of his Master refers to the [true] locating (mawḍiʿ) of his realisation of the divine oneness, and his obedience to God and His Messenger.So, according to the strength of his perception (baṣar) of God, he will attain full awareness (taqwā) and awe (rahba) of Him. The root of full awareness of God is in relinquishing the lower self (mubāyanat al-nafs), so let [the servant] relinquish [the lower self] for this, and not accommodate any of the pleasures [demanded by] its desire (hawā), nor any of those pleasures to which it [the lower self] is summoning him, and for which it has no excuse. Know that human beings will vary in rank on the Day of Resurrection according to the measure of the light of certainty that they possess. The weightier the certainty a person has the heavier will his scales weigh, even though there might [otherwise] be less in his scales.He [Sahl] was asked, "How can you tell the soundness of someone"s certainty?" To which he replied:By the strength of his confidence (thiqa) in God, Exalted is He, and his good opinion (ḥusn al-ẓann) of Him. Trust in God is witnessing (mushāhada) through certainty (yaqīn), the eye of certainty (ʿayn al-yaqīn), and the wholeness [of its vision] (kulliyyatihi). Its perfection and goal is the attainment of God, Mighty and Majestic is He.</text>

      <text>"And fear Me When asked about this verse, Sahl replied:What He means by this is [their being aware] of His prior knowledge concerning them, that is, "You should never feel secure from the [divine] ruse (makr), nor of His act of giving respite (istidrāj), such that your hearts become complacent in the observance of your security in this world while you persist in falling short [in good works]; nor should you rely upon My leniency towards you in the matter of [not] hastening your punishment, in that same [false] sense of security, and in your delusion (ightirār) and heedlessness (ghafla), lest you perish." The Prophet said: "Had Jesus the son of Mary had greater certainty (yaqīn) he would have walked in the air as he walked on water." And truly our Prophet traversed the air on the Night Journey (Isrāʾ) due to the strength of the light of his certainty, [a certainty] which God, Exalted is He, granted to him from His light, as an increase in light to the light that he already possessed from God, Exalted is He. The Prophet also said: "If gnosis (maʿrifa) had remained firmly rooted in the heart of David and he had not slipped into negligence, he would not have fallen into disobedience." By my life, truly gnosis (maʿrifa) was enclosed within its own abodes (udrijat fī awṭānihā), in order that what was contained within God"s prior knowledge concerning him would befall him. This is because it [God"s prior knowledge] inevitably had to be manifested in his qualities, since God"s knowledge is a final decree that cannot change to other than what the All-Knowing knows, Mighty and Majestic is He. Indeed God, Mighty and Majestic is He, concealed [from David]</text>

      <text>And do not obscure the truth with falsehood, and do not conceal truth wittingly.Sahl was asked about this verse, to which he replied:This means, "Do not cover up a matter of the Hereafter because of a worldly concern." What [God] means is that it is not allowed for the people of truth to conceal the truth from the people of truth (ahl al-ḥaqq) in particular, or from those who long to be guided thereby to God. As for the people of truth, they will increase in insight (baṣīra) [through hearing it], and as for those who are not of the elite of the people of truth, the words of God are a source of guidance for them and of direction to God, Exalted is He.</text>

As you know, those who are addressed in this verse had not killed a prophet at the time of the Prophet, nor was there at that time any other Prophet but him. However, God addressed them with reference to those who came before them among their kin, as He addressed the Prophet with what was in reality directed to his nation [as a whole] with His words: O Prophet! When you [men] divorce women, divorce them by their prescribed period [65:1] The same [principle applies] to His words: About what are they questioning one another?!

      <text>They are those on whom [descend] blessings from their Lord, and mercy; it is they who are truly guided.Sahl said:What is implied by blessings (ṣalawāt) upon them is the bestowal of mercy (taraḥḥum) upon them, that is, a bestowal of mercy from their Lord. The Prophet said, "May God bless the family of Abū Awfāʾ, when they brought him charitable donations, by which he meant "[May God] have mercy on them." He also said:Muḥammad b. Sawwār told us on the authority of Abū ʿAmr b. ʿAlāʾ that he said: "Ṣalāt" has three meanings, one of which is the prescribed prayer with its bowings and prostrations, which is referred to when God says: So pray to Your Lord and sacrifice [108:2], that is, grasp your left arm with your right hand in prayer, in self-abasement and in awe before God, Exalted is He. Thisis also reported from ʿAlī. The second meaning is to show mercy (taraḥḥum) [as discussed above], and the third meaning is supplication (duʿāʾ), as [for example] in the prayer over the dead. Indeed, the Prophet said: "If any of you are invited for a meal, you should [accept the invitation]. But if [the one invited] is fasting he should pray", that is, he should make a supplicationfor them to be endowed with blessing. Furthermore, the Prophet said in a ḥadīth, ""and may the angels pray over you", meaning pray for mercy to be bestowed upon you. In this [same] ḥadīth the Prophet went on to say, "And if someone eats at his house, the angels pray over him [the host] until eventide", meaning the angels supplicate for him. Sahl continued:Ṣalāt carries two meanings: one is the seeking of forgiveness (istighfār), and the other is forgiveness itself (maghfira). As for the meaning of "seeking forgiveness", it is referred to in His words, And pray for them [9:103], that is, ask forgiveness for them; [and in His words], to [secure] the prayers of the Messenger [9:99], meaning asking for the Messenger"s supplication for forgiveness.</text>

      <text>(Yet there are people who take to themselves idols), loving them as if loving God; but those who believe love God more ardently"He said:It means that they love idols (andād) in the way that they love God, Mighty and Majestic is He. Indeed, God, Exalted is He, described the intensity of their disbelief and their constancy (ṣidq) in the state of disbelief as ignorance (jahl). He then described the love of the believers and their constancy in the state of faith in God, as truth (ḥaqq). Then He accorded superiority to the believers due to their knowledge [or gnosis, maʿrifa], saying, those who believe love God more ardently. This is due to their knowledge (maʿrifa), and all the other things that cause the believing servant to advance towards God and establish His remembrance. This is the level ofthe loving mystics (ʿārifūn muḥibbūn), since love is the inclination (ʿaṭf) for the purest reality (khāliṣat al-ḥaqq), which God, Exalted is He, [produces] in them.He was asked, "What is the sign of love?" He replied:It is the embracing of obedience and the relinquishing of [any sense] of need [for other than God] (mubāyanat al-fāqa). It has been related that God, Exalted is He, said in a revelation to Moses, "Do you know why I cast my love upon you?", to which he replied, "No, O Lord." He said, "Because you sought My delight (masarra). O Moses, [always] keep Me in mind, and don"t forget Me in any situation. Let your aspiration (himma) be for My remembrance (dhikr), for I will take care of your path." But God, Transcendent and Exalted is He, knows best.</text>

      <text>And take provision, but the best of provisions is mindfulness of God... He [Sahl] said:It [mindfulness of God, taqwā] is the [best travelling] companion (rafīq) leading to the remembrance(dhikr) of God, Exalted is He, in fear (khawfan); just as there is no [travelling] provision (zād) for the lover (muḥibb) save the Beloved (maḥbūb), and no provision for the possessor of mystical knowledge (ʿārif) save the Known (maʿrūf). [Continuing on from this] Sahl explained that the words, If he is able to make his way there [3:97] are an allusion to the provision (zād) and the riding beast (rāḥila). He then asked, "Do you know what the provision and riding beast are?" They replied: "No". So he said, "The provision is remembrance (dhikr) and the riding beast is patience (ṣabr)." Then he went on to relate how a man had accompanied him on the road to Mecca, and for two days had not found anything [to eat], so he said, "O teacher! I need sustenance!" to which he [Sahl] replied, "Sustenance is God." The other man then said, "One cannot do without sustenance for the body to function." To which he replied, "All bodies exist [only] through God, Mighty and Majestic is He." Then he recited the following lines [in the basīṭ metre]:O Beloved, replenish [my longing]! May the water of longing pour down upon you from the rain cloud,Whose pouring increases my sorrows and anguish.An anguish remains in my heart, consuming me,Truly as love increases, with it will increase my rapture. After that, he said, "It is the world that severs those who are devoted to God from God, Mighty and Majestic is He." Finally, he said, "The livelihood (ʿaysh) of angels is in obedience (ṭāʿa); the livelihood of the prophets is in knowledge (ʿilm) and waiting for relief (intiẓār al-faraj); and the livelihood of the veracious (ṣiddīqūn) is in emulation (iqtidāʾ).

Ah, but surely God"s help is nigh.Sahl was asked concerning these words, "Did they ask this because they found that help slow in arriving?" He replied:No, but when they lost hope in their own devising (tadbīr) they said, "When will God"s help come?" Hence, when God, Exalted is He, saw that they had given up on their own power (ḥawl), strength (quwwa) and devising (tadbīr), and saw their display of neediness for Him, and [their admission that] they had no means without Him, He responded to them with His words, Ah, but surely God"s help is nigh.Sahl further said:Affliction (balāʾ) and well-being (ʿāfiya) are from God, Mighty and Majestic is He. The commandand prohibition are from Him; protection and the granting of success are from Him; and reward and punishment are from Him. However, actions are attributed (manṣūba) to the children of Adam, so whoever performs a good action must express gratitude to merit thereby an increase [in goodness]; and whoever performs a wicked act must seek forgiveness, so that he thereby merits forgiveness. Affliction from God is of two kinds: an affliction of mercy and an affliction of punishment. An affliction of mercy leads the afflicted person to show his utter need (iftiqār) for God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and leads him to the abandonment of devising(tadbīr). However, an affliction of punishment leads the afflicted person [to rely] on his own choice (ikhtiyār) and devising.Sahl was then asked, "Which is more difficult, patience (ṣabr) in [a state of] well-being or patience during adversity?" He replied:Asking for safety (salāma) in times of security is more difficult than asking for safety in [a state of] fear.[On the same subject] Sahl said regarding His words, And if anyone believes in God, [God] guides his heart [aright] [64:11], "[Whoever] believes in God and that his affliction comes from God, will find his heart guided by God to the expectation of relief (intiẓār al-faraj) from Him".His words:</text>

Then [in this connection] someone mentioned to him the verse: It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards East or West [2:177], and he [Sahl] said:This means: it is not righteousness that you do nothing other than this; [True] righteousness is [that of] the one who believes in God [2:177], to the end of that verse. Do you not notice how He says, Do you bid others to righteousness, while you forget [to practise it] yourselves?

He abandoned whom He willed to his desire, so that the act which He had forbidden would become manifest from that person, and He did not grant His protection, out of His justice and decree.

      <text>Maintain the prayers"That is, "Persist in upholding them". However His words, And establish prayer and pay the alms. [24:56], have two aspects, one of which is establishing prayer without the affirmation [of faith], just as when He said in Sūra Barāʾa, if they repent, [9:5] meaning, from idolatry (shirk), and establish regular prayers" [9:5], that is, committing themselves to prayer and almsgiving, then let them be. In this regard, He also said: Yet if they repent, establish prayer, and pay the obligatory alms, then they are your brothers in religion [9:11] [and comrades]. There is something similarto this in Sūrat al-Sajda. The second aspect of establishing [the prayers] (iqāma) is referred to when He says in Sūrat al-Mujādala, Then establish the prayer and pay the obligatory alms [58:13], as in Sūrat al-Muzzammil [73:20], and again with His words in Sūrat al-Māʾida, [believers who] establish the prayer [5:55], meaning that they fulfil it [that duty] completely.</text>
      <text>"especially the middle prayer" [Sahl] was asked about these words, and the reason why [the middle prayer] is singled out. He replied:It is singled out due to a particular characteristic it possesses, even though it is not apart from the obligatory prayers as a whole, in the same way that Gabriel and others were singled out for mention among the host of the angels, due to a certain particularity.He continued:There is another reason, namely, that the times of the rest of the prayers are known by both the knowledgeable and the ignorant, because their signs are obvious. However, the time for the ʿAṣr prayer is less clear. Thus by mentioning [this prayer] in particular, He urged people to take care to observe it at its correct time.His words [that follow in the same verse]:"And stand before God in submissionThat is, "Stand before God in prayer in a state of obedience, for many a worshipper is disobedient,such as the hypocrite and his like. The Prophet was asked, "Which prayer is the best?" He replied, "The longest in devotion (qunūt), that is, the prayer [for which] one stands the longest (ṭūl al-qiyām). And Zayd b. Arqam said that being devout (qunūt) is silence, for we used to speak during the prayer until God, Exalted is He, sent down the words, And stand before God in submission [2:238], after which we desisted from speaking [during prayer]. Muḥammad b. Sawwār said, "The qunūt is the witr, which was called a (qunūt) because of the supplication (duʿāʾ) which is offered in it whilst standing, aside from the recitation of Qurʾān." This is a kind of magnifying (taʿẓīm) [of God] through supplication.</text>

Within it is God"s Greatest Name, and it is written across the sky in green light in one line from East to West. This is how I saw it written on the Night of Great Merit (Laylat al-Qadr) in ʿAbbādān: There is no god except Him, the Living, the Eternal Sustainer.The Living, the Eternal Sustainer is the One who oversees everything pertaining to His creatures: their life spans, their actions, and their provision. He is the One who requites goodness (iḥsān) with goodness, and misdeeds with forgiveness (ghufrān), but He requites hypocrisy, disbelief and innovation with punishment. Whoever pronounces the saying: "There is no god except God" has made a pact with God, so it is unlawful for him, after making a pact with God, to disobey Him in any of His commandments or prohibitions, in secret or public, or to support His enemy, or to show enmity towards a friend of His."No slumber can seize Him, nor sleep" Slumber (sina) here means sleepiness.He [Sahl] also said:Slumber is when the heart (qalb) is mingled with sleep.</text>

He is their protectordue to the former guidance He granted them, and His knowledge concerning them, of their affirmation of His oneness. This is due to His knowledge that they have freed themselves from every cause except their Creator. Hence they were taken out of the darkness into the light, and from disbelief, error, disobedience and innovation to faith, which is the light that God, Mighty and Majestic is He, established in their hearts. This is the light of the insight of certainty (nūr baṣīrat al-yaqīn) by which they seek inner perception of the divine oneness (tawḥīd), and obedience to Him in that which He has commanded and forbidden. For anyone to whom God gives no light, there is no light! [24:40]His words, Mighty and Majestic is He:</text>

      <text>And when Abraham said, "My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead""[Sahl] was asked whether or not Abraham was in doubt concerning his faith, and was therefore asking his Lord to show him a sign or miracle in order to restore his faith. He replied:His question was not out of doubt; he was merely asking for an increase in certainty (ziyādat al-yaqīn) to the faith he already had. Thus he asked for an unveiling of the cover of visual beholding with his physical eyes, so that by the light of certainty, his own certainty regarding God"s omnipotence might be increased, and [his certainty] regarding His creative [power] mightth be consolidated. Do you not notice how when He asked [him], "Why, do you not believe?" he replied "Yes." If he had been in doubt he would not have said "Yes". Furthermore, if God was aware of any doubt in him and had he given Him the answer "Yes", [attempting to] conceal his doubt, God would definitely have disclosed that, Exalted is He, as such things cannot be concealed from Him. Therefore, this confirms that the request for [his heart"s] reassurance (ṭumaʾnīna) signified a request for an increase in his certainty. Then it was asked, "Surely the people of the "Table Spread" sought profound peace of mind, through the sending down of the feast, and their [request] was out of doubt. So how does this correspond?" He replied:Abraham made it known that he was a believer, and he only asked for profound peace of mind in addition to faith in order to receive greater [certainty]. The people of the Table Spread, on the other hand, made it known that they would believe only after they had found calm reassurance in their hearts. As He said: and that our hearts may be reassured, and that we may know that you have spoken to us truthfully [5:113]. Thus they made it known that their knowledge of his [Jesus"] truthfulness, after they had been reassured by witnessing the feast, was to be the starting point of their faith.Abū Bakr [al-Sijzī] said: I heard him say on another occasion:"But so that my heart may be reassured" [2:260] " that is, "I do not feel secure against one of Your enemies challenging me if I should say, My Lord is He who gives life and death [2:258], and then [one of them] should ask, "Did you see Him give life and death?" In this way my heart would be at ease in being able to answer "Yes" to him, once I had witnessed that.</text>

      <text>"And he who is given wisdom has been given much good.He was asked about these words and he said:Abū Saʿīd al-Khuḍrī narrated from the Prophet that he said: "The Qurʾān is God"s wisdom (ḥikma) among His servants. Whoever learns the Qurʾān and acts according to it, it is as if prophethood were incorporated within him, except that he does not receive revelation. He is called to account in the same way as the prophets except in the matter of conveying the message." And Muḥammad b. Sawwār reported to me from ʿAqīl, from Ibn al-Musayyab, on the authorityof Abū Hurayra that he stated that the Prophet said, "The Qurʾān is wisdom, andwhoever learns the Qurʾān in his youth, it mingles with his flesh and blood. And surely the Fire cannot touch a heart which contains the Qurʾān, nor a body which avoids that which it prohibits (maḥārim), and keeps to what it permits (ḥalāl), believes in that which is clear [in it] (muḥkam), refrains from judgement in that which is ambiguous [in it] (mutashābih), and does not make innovations regarding it." Mujāhid and Ṭāwūs said, "Wisdom is the Qurʾān, as He says in Sūrat al-Naḥl, Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom [16:125], meaning the Qurʾān. Ḥasan said, "Wisdom is the understanding of the Qurʾān, and wisdom is prophethood, as He says in Sūrat Ṣād, and gave him wisdom" [38:20], meaning prophethood (nubuwwa). And God said [concerning] David, And God gave him kingship and wisdom [2:251] meaning prophethood, along with the Book. Qatāda said, "Wisdom is understanding the religion of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and following the Messenger of God "; Suddī said: "Wisdom is prophethood"; Zayd b.</text>

      <text>[Charity is] for the poor, who are constrained in the way of God"Sahl was asked about these words and the difference between the poor (fuqarāʾ) and the abject (masākīn). He replied:God, Exalted is He, described the poor (faqīr) in terms of destitution (ʿadam) due to their state of asking Him out of utter neediness (iftiqār) and resorting (lijāʾ) to Him. He also described them as having the qualities of contentment (riḍā) and satisfaction [with their lot] (qunūʿ), for He said, Exalted is He, "They do not beg from men importunately [2:273].These are the People of the Bench (Ahl al-Ṣuffa) of the Messenger of God who were about forty men. They did not have any dwellings in Medina nor [did they belong to] any tribes. These were the circumstances of a group of people whom God, Exalted is He, praised for the high degree of their dependence on Him. They had no ability (istiṭāʿa), nor any strength (quwwa) except in Him and from Him. He was their power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa). He uprooted from them the power for their hearts to depend (sukūn) on anything other than Him, which is the incitement (waswasa) of the lower self towards that which is other than God, Exalted is He. Because of this [quality] they are elevated in their [spiritual] state. But [this is unlike] the one whom God turns back to the acquiescence of his lower self (musākana nafsihi), [about whom] He said, It belonged to deprived people (masākin) who worked at sea [18:79]. He returned them to the situation in which they had acquiesced. However, as regards the poor and needy person (faqīr), whose want has made him surrender himself to God, Exalted is He, his action involves[combatting] the desire (hawā) of his lower self, and thus he is in a better state than the one who acquiesces in whatever state he is in, due to following his lower self.ʿUmar b. Wāṣil said, "If one needy of God (faqīr ilā"Llāh), Mighty and Majestic is He, is satisfied, [yet] does not depend on [his state of] contentment (riḍā) and self-surrender (taslīm), then both names are true for him: poverty (faqr) and lowliness (maskana)." Abū Bakr [al-Sijzī] said that he heard Sahl say:The poor person is [one who is both] poor [and] helpless (faqīr ʿājiz).</text>

They do not know what will be done with them due to My curse on them, whether they will be killed or tortured, or let off and set free.

      <text>"As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow the allegorical part, desiring sedition"That is, disbelief; "and desiring its interpretation, refers to its interpretation according to the desire of their lower selves. "But no one knows its interpretation except God.Ibn ʿAbbās y said:God sent down the Qurʾān according to four ways of reading (aḥruf): the lawful (ḥalāl) and the unlawful (ḥarām), ignorance of which nobody is excused; the interpretation (tafsīr) according to which the Arabs have interpreted it; the interpretation according to which scholars (ʿulamāʾ) have interpreted it; and the ambiguous (mutashābih), which none but God, Exalted is He, knows, and whoever claims knowledge of it other than God, Mighty and Majestic is He, is lying. His words:</text>
      <text>"And those who are firmly rooted in knowledge (rāsikhūna fī"l-ʿilm)"[Sahl] said:It was reported from ʿAlī that he stated, "[Those rooted in knowledge] are the ones whom knowledge has protected from plunging [into the interpretation of the Qurʾān] according to some whim (hawā) or with set arguments (ḥujaj maḍrūba) without [awareness of] the unseen [mysteries] (ghuyūb)." [This is] due to God"s guidance of them, and His disclosing to them His unseen secrets from within the treasure chests of knowledge. Thus they said, We believe in the Book; all of it is from our Lord [3:7]. So God, Exalted is He, acknowledged them [in this verse], and made them among the people of profound and far-reaching knowledge, as an increase granted to them from Him. Just as God has said, Exalted is He, But say: "O my Lord! Advance me in knowledge [20:114]".Sahl also said:God, Blessed and Exalted is He, showed those who are firmly rooted in knowledge to be exceptionalbecause of their saying all of it is from our Lord [3:7], by which they mean, the abrogating and the abrogated, the clear and the ambiguous. They are the ones who reveal three [ways of] knowing (ʿulūm), since those who know (ʿulamāʾ) may be [designated in] three [ways], namely: those [whose knowledge derives from] the divine lordliness (rabbāniyyūn), those [whose knowledge derives from] the divine light (nurāniyyūn); and those [whose knowledge derives from] the divine essence" (dhātiyyūn). [Those firmly rooted in knowledge reveal] in addition four [other kinds] of knowledge: revelation (waḥy), theophany (tajallī), knowledge directly bestowed by God (ʿindī) and knowledge from the divine presence (ladunnī), just as God has said, to whom We had given mercy from Us and We had taught him knowledge from Us [18:65], [and when He said], Yet none remembers but the people of inner substance [2:269], that is, none reflects save the people of understanding (fahm) and intellect (ʿuqūl), who say:</text>

Protect me! Protect me! Keep me safe! Keep me safe! Help me! Help me!" God, Exalted is He, has said, As He brought you into being, so shall you return [7:29].Every person who affirms God"s oneness should know for a certainty that not everyone who loves God (Ḥaqq) is loved by Him, for Iblīs encountered Him with the ⸢outward sign⸣ of love and said, "Shall I prostrate before one whom You have created from clay [17:61], when You are God, and it is not permissible to worship other than You?" Consequently God cursed him. Therefore, not all those who try to draw close to God are accepted by Him. Nor does God accept the obedience (ṭāʿa) of all who obey Him. Truly He perceives what is in the conscience (ḍamīr) [of all His creatures]. Thus, no one can feel secure that God will not deal with him in the same way that He dealt with Iblīs. God cursed him with the lights of His protection (bi-anwār ʿiṣmatihi) such that he was always in reality under His curse, but God veiled him from what had been foreordained [for him] from Him, up until the time when He punished him by bringing it to realisation through him. Thus, the servant can do nothing except continually [implore] help (ghawth) from God. Indeed the Messenger said, "O You who make the steadfast firm, make me firm with Your firmness (thabāt)! O You whose oneness is unchanging, for there is no god except You, Glorified are You! Truly I have been among the wrongdoers." He wouldalso say: "O Lord and Protector (walī) of Islam and its people, make me firm in Islam until I encounter You!" [Sahl] said [on this matter], "The place of faith in God, Exalted is He, is the heart and the place of Islam is the breast, and it is subject to increase and decrease." His words:</text>

      <text>God bears witness"He [Sahl] said:That is, God knows and makes clear (bayyana) "that there is no god but He. He is witness to Himself by Himself; and this is particular to His essence. He called to witness those of His creatures whom He called to witness before their creation, according to His knowledge. Consequently, the people possessed of His gnosis (maʿrifa) are made aware that He had full knowledge of everything that will be before it was actually brought into existence. Hence, [God"s] oneness (tawḥīd) is independent of existentiated beings (dūn al-akwān), just as God was a witness to Himself by Himself before the existence of creation.ʿAbd al-Wāḥid said:I was with Ayyūb al-Sakhtiyānī when he saw a porter carrying wood. I asked him, "Do you have a Lord?" to which he replied, "Is the likes of me questioned about his Lord?" So I said to him, "If you have a Creator as you claim, why do you work with wood?" Then the man indicated to the sky, and lo and behold, the wood became gold! We were both amazed by him on account of this. Then he said, "O God! I have no need for this", so the gold turned back to wood just as it was before. So we said to him, "What led you to do this?", to which he replied, "I am [God"s] slave, so I carry this in order that I should not forget who I am." His words:</text>

Come to a word agreed upon (kalimatin sawāʾin) between us and you: that we worship none but God""That is, "[Let us] seek a just [agreement] (ṭamʿin ʿadlin) between us and you." This is because they affirmed that their Creator and the Creator of the heavens and the earth was God, Exalted is He, and [agreed]: "Let us declare His oneness and not worship anyone except Him."The basis of worship is the profession of God"s oneness (tawḥīd) along with living according to what is lawful, while avoiding the harm [of others] (kaff al-adhā). Furthermore, a person cannotaccomplish living by what is lawful without abandoning the harm of others, and likewise he does not abandon causing harm save through living by what is lawful. If you know how to abide by what is lawful, how to abandon causing harm, and the [correct] intention (nīya) behind actions, as well as you know the Fātiḥa [Sūrat al-Fātiḥa], then your faith will become pure, as will your hearts and bodily members.

Thus, whoever is not benefited by his belief that "There is no god save God" and his adherence to the Sunna of the Messenger of God, is as a dead person.Sahl added:Truly I know a man among the friends of God, Exalted is He, who passed by a man who had been crucified (maṣlūb) with his head fixed in a direction away from the qibla.

Sawwār said, "The person [whose knowledge derives from the] divine lordliness (rabbānī) is the one who does not choose anyone over his Lord, and it [the name] is derived from the word rubūbiyya". Sahl continued:People whose knowledge derives from the divine lordliness (rabbāniyūn) are those who are elevated in the degree of [their] knowledge by virtue of [that] knowledge, just as Muḥammad b. Ḥanafiyya said on the death of ʿAbd Allāh Ibn ʿAbbās y, "Indeed, today one whose knowledge derived from the divine lordliness (rabbānī) in this community (umma) has died. Furthermore, he [the rabbānī] is associated with the Lord (rabb) because he is knowledgeable through His knowledge, just as He said, She asked, "Who told you this?" He said, "I was told by the All-Knowing, the Aware" [66:3]. He [the Prophet] related it to prophethood (nubuwwa), because of that which God had taught him, Mighty and Majestic is He. Thus, anyone who informs you of something which conforms to the Book and the Sunna, is "an informant" (munbiʾ). Those possessed of knowledge are of three kinds: there is the one whose knowledge derives from the divine lordliness (rabbānī), the one whose knowledge derives from the divine light (nūrānī), and the one whose knowledge derives from the divine essence (dhātī), [who has] no intermediary between him and God most High; within him is a "subsisting" (baqiyya) of God, Mighty and Majestic is He. [On the other hand], ʿUmar b. Wāṣil said: those whose knowledge derives from the divine lordliness (rabbāniyyūn) are the collectivity of scholars. This resembles a saying of ʿAlī, "People are of three kinds: the knower whose knowledge derives from the divine lordliness (ʿālim rabbānī), the person acquiring knowledge (mutaʿallim) on the path to salvation, and the commoners and riff-raff, who follow every charlatan.

Furthermore, there is no spending (infāq) like consuming (infāq) the lower self by opposing it, and by seeking the good pleasure of God, Mighty and Majestic is He.Then he related a story of Jesus :Once he passed by three people whose bodies were emaciated and faces pale. He asked them, "What has brought you to this state I see you in?" They said, "The fear (khawf) of our Creator and wariness (ḥadhr) of punishment for our disobedience." He responded, "God made it incumbent upon Himself to grant safety to the one who fears [Him]." Then he moved on until he came to three other people who were even more emaciated. He asked them, "What has brought you to this state I see you in?" They answered, "The yearning (shawq) for our Lord." He replied, "God made it incumbent upon Himself to grant you what you wish for." Then he moved on until he came to three people who were even more emaciated, whose faces were like full moons. He asked, "What has brought you to this state I see you in?" They replied: "Love (ḥubb)." He said, "You are the people of proximity [with God] (muqarrabūn)", and he said it thrice. Thus, whoever loves God, Exalted is He, is one of the people of proximity [with God], for if anyone loves something they hasten towards it.So the first level is the rank of the repentant (tawwābūn); the second is that of the people of longing (mushtāqūn), and then the servant reaches the third rank which is that of love.

      <text>On the Day when some faces are whitened"This means, the faces of the believers will become white through the light of their faith; "and some faces are blackened", namely, the [faces] of the disbelievers, due to the darkness of their disbelief.He was asked about His words, Abasement and wretchedness were cast upon them [2:61]. He replied:The purpose of these bodies is in the "deposits" (waḍāʾiʿ) that God has placed within them, by which He puts His creatures to the test. Among [these deposits] is one from which the obedient(ṭāʾiʿūn) should draw admonitory lessons, namely, disbelief (kufr). [On the other hand], there are those which are proof against the heedless (ghāfilūn), namely, gnosis (maʿrifa) and affirmation (taṣdīq) through speech and actions, just as He has said, And He appointed darknessesand light [6:1]. The inner meaning of this verse is that light is knowledge (ʿilm) and darkness is ignorance (jahl), in accordance with His words, And he whom God has not granted any light has no light [24:40], that is, the heart [of such a person] has not [the light] by which to perceive faith in God. The light of faith is one of the greatest blessings (minan) of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and tokens of His generosity (karāmāt). The second [blessing] is the "good word" which is referred to in His words, Exalted is He, Come now to a word that is agreed upon between us and you [3:64]. The third [great blessing] is obedience (iṭāʿa) that the bodily members carry out purely for God"s sake, as when the prayers are maintained and obligatory alms (zakāt) are paid [in a spirit of] satisfaction (qunūʿ) and contentment (riḍā). Thus, [in this latter verse] He summoned them to the best speech, and the most excellent actions. If it had not been for faith in God and the Qurʾān, which is the knowledge of God, and which contains a call [for people] to affirm His lordship and to serve Him in fear, then the prophets, upon whom be blessings and peace, would not have known who among the people had responded to them.His words:</text>

      <text>Truly, those of you who turned back the day the two hosts met, truly, it was Satan who caused them to slip, because of some of what they had earned"[Sahl] was asked about the meaning of that earning (kasb). He said:It was the complacency that they felt because of their great numbers on the day of Ḥunayn and the glory they had gained on the Day of Badr. This was due to Satan coming to associatewith them, after [he saw] the acquiescence (musākana) of their hearts, and their regard for themselves, because of the complacency (iʿjāb) that their own lower selves had seduced them into. So God lifted His protection (ʿiṣma) from them as a punishment. Indeed, when the Prophet heard his Companions say on the Day of Ḥunayn, "We shall not be overcome by so few", he warned them, "Do not wish to encounter the enemy, rather ask for safety (ʿāfiya) from God, Exalted is He", from dependency on your own devising (tadbīr) in any situation, and from [being unaware of your] neediness (dūn al-iftiqār) for God, Mighty and Majestic is He.See how when David asked his Lord to join him with the ranks of Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, He replied, "You are not on that level, O David." He asked, "Why is that O Lord?", to which God replied, "Because I tested them and they showed patience. Furthermore, they did not know the world and the world did not know them. But you have known the world and it has known you, and you adopted it as your kin." David said, "Show me one from among your servants who, if You tested him, would show patience." Then God, Mighty and Majestic is He, said, "I"m going to test you." Thus he [David] became the first to request affliction (balāʾ), ⸢and the one who exposed himself to⸣ testing (imtiḥān) from God, Exalted is He. That is to say, this was [of course] in accordance with God"s prior knowledge in the veiled unseen, which is solely known to Him. Then Iblīs came to him in the form of a pigeon and the story took place involving Uriah b. Ḥanān. God did not protect [David] from desire, intent or action. However, He protectedJoseph from action, though He did not protect him from desire and intent. His words:</text>

      <text>It was by the mercy of God that you [Muḥammad] were lenient with them"This means, "Due to an act of sympathy (ʿaṭf ) from God you dealt gently with them", And if you had been harsh, with [your] tongue, and fierce of heart, they would have dispersed from about you, that is, "They would have separated themselves from you". So pardon them, that is, "Overlook their faults", and ask forgiveness for them, for their defeat on the Day of Uḥud. Consult them in the matter, that is, "Do not distance them from yourself because of their disobedience, but accommodate them through your graciousness (faḍl), for it is through Us that you pardon, through Us that you seek forgiveness, and to Us that you turn for guidance". Then, when you are resolved, that is, "If you wish to carry something out after consultation", put your trust in God", that is, "Rely on God notwithstanding that [consultation], consign all your affairs to Him, and depend on Him without regard for anyone else." He [the Prophet] did not leave this world before God, Exalted is He, had disclosed to his heart realms of knowledge which were between him and God, Exalted is He, without any intermediary, due to his love of pondering and reflection, in reverent awareness (iʿtibār) of the omnipotence of his Lord, so that he attained an increase from God most High, just as He was commanded in the words of God, Exalted is He, But say: "My Lord! Increase me in knowledge" [20:114]. Furthermore, he enjoined this upon his nation (umma), as is related from the Prophet in his words, "Consult those who are mindful of God (muttaqūn), who have preferred the Hereafter over this world, and who give you priority over themselves in your affairs." And he also said, "Consult the righteous scholars, and when you have made your resolve to carry something out, put your trust in God."He [Sahl] said [in this regard]:Fraternise with brothers among the people who are mindful of God, and let the person whom you consult be one of those who fear God, Exalted is He. Let your word not be broken. And never be hostile to anyone until you know the states of his conduct with God, Exalted is He.</text>

      <text>If God helps you, then no one can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, then who is there who can help you after Him?...He said:To be forsaken (khidhlān) means to be utterly abandoned (ghāyat al-tark). As for abandonment itself (tark), that is for the sinner who recognises his sin. Being forsaken (khidhlān), however, is for the one who sins while believing that he is doing something good. This is God"s punishment to the one who is forsaken, for He upholds him in sin, having the knowledge both of his sin and of his subsequent procrastination of repentance. Do you not see how Iblīs, when he refused [to obey], and persisted in that refusal was forsaken by God due to His prior knowledge about him? This is because He willed from him that which was in accordance with His knowledge; He did not will from him that which was in accordance with His command. However Adam, because he was not forsaken in his abandonment, confessed to his sin after committing it and returned to his Lord, Majestic and Mighty is He, and his repentance was accepted.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

He replied:Trust is the submission of the body in servanthood, the attachment of the heart to the divine lordliness (rubūbiyya) and the disclaiming of all power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa).Then he was asked: "What is the reality (ḥaqīqa) of trust (tawakkul) in principle?" He replied:At its root, the reality of trust is the realisation of God"s oneness (tawḥīd), while its branch is the knowledge of the Last Day [lit. knowledge of the Hour] (ilm al-sāʿa); and through tranquil repose (sukūn) in it [trust] there is visual beholding (muʿāyana).Then he said:Do not be anxious about trust, for truly it is a means of livelihood for those who possess it.He was asked, "Who are those who possess it?" He replied:They are those who have been privileged with a special quality.Sahl was asked to clarify this further, and he said:Truly all the sciences are the lowest categories of worship (taʿabbud). The sum of all worship is only the lowest category of scrupulous piety (waraʿ). The sum of all renunciation (zuhd) is the lowest category of the manifestation of divine omnipotence (ẓuhūr al-qudra). Furthermore, the divine omnipotence does not become apparent to anyone except the one who has complete trust (mutawakkil). Trust is not susceptible of any categorical definition, nor does it have a limit that would make it susceptible of comparison, nor does it have an utmost degree that can be reached.Then he was asked, "Describe something of it to us" and he replied:Trust has a thousand ranks, the first of which is the ability to walk on air. He was then asked, "How does the servant reach that level?" He answered:The first thing is gnosis (maʿrifa), then affirmation (iqrār), then the realisation of God"s oneness (tawḥīd), then submission (islām), then the excellence in faith (iḥsān), then the committing of one"s affairs [to God] (tafwīḍ), then trust (tawakkul), and finally the state of tranquil repose (sukūn) in God, Mighty and Majestic is He, in every situation. And he added:Trust is not acceptable from anyone except one who is mindful of God (muttaqī).He was asked, "What is mindfulness of God?" He replied:It is to refrain from all harm [to others] (adhā).

But, their final destination is the Fire. This is what is meant by His words, [Thehypocrites] try to deceive God, but it is He who causes them to be deceived. He meant by this the speed of delivering their recompense (jazāʾ) for what they perform and abstain from. This is as His saying, Nay, but you marvel while they engage in ridicule [37:12], by which He meant that He hastened their punishment for their persisting in denial [of the truth]. Thus were His words addressed in accordance with the name of their action. And indeed in [other] places He describes their being in a state of wonder (ʿajab); [for example,] in His words, [Say, "It has been revealed to me that a company of jinn listened and said], "We have heard a wondrous Qurʾān"" [72:1]; and in Sūra Qāf, Nay, but they [the disbelievers] think it strange [50:2]; and in Sūra Ṣād: What an astonishing thing! [38:5]. So also [wonder] is mentioned in Sūra Ṣāffāt: Nay but you marvel while they engage in ridicule [37:12], that is, you see their recompense as immense (ʿaẓīm), And here He calls the immense recompense a marvel, for the one who marvels at something that has reached its utmost degree, and this is what is meant in His words, you marvel.It has been related that Shaqīq read [the Qurʾānic words] to Sharīḥ as "I marvel (ʿajibtu)" to which Sharīḥ replied, "[It should be] you marvel (ʿajibta)", for truly God does not marvel at anything. The only one who marvels is one who does not know." Then Shaqīq said, "I informed Ibrāhīm of this, and he said, "For sure, Sharīḥ is pleased with his own knowledge.

Furthermore, if you had turned to the Provider (al-Razzāq), your provision would have been taken care of. Then he said:You are not greater than ʿAmr b.

Eventually it came to pass that he was imprisoned in a house after being handed over to the Caliph, who subsequently deprived him of food and drink. When his door was opened they found him dead with his mouth full of straw and clay due to his intense hunger. Then he [the Caliph] said, "Truly I have advised you and truly I am among those who give you good counsel."It was related by Mālik b. Dīnār, from Ḥammād b. Salma and Ḥammād b.

I think you must be hungry, so if you are hungrygo over to that pot with the flour and make yourselves whatever takes your fancy." Then, one of those who were with her remarked, "If only we had some garlic."

They came to the Prophet, and the Qurʾān was recited for them. They were deeply moved by it so that their eyes overflowed [with tears], and they were not haughty, due to God"s protecting them from pride. Subsequently, they entered His religion because of the knowledge of God which He had deposited within them.Then he said:The corruption of religion is in three things: when kings commit excess[es] and [follow] their lusts; when the scholars issue rulings based on concessions; and when the Qurʾān reciters worshipwithout knowledge. Truly, people need the learned (ʿulamāʾ) for their life in this world and the Hereafter. Indeed, it was related by Jābir b. ʿAbd Allāh from the Prophet that he said: "The people of Paradise need the learned just as much as the people need them in this world.

David replied [by asking], "O my Lord! Where can I find You when I wish to seek you out?" He said, "With those whose hearts are broken from the fear of Me." David then said, "O my Lord! I approached the doctors among Your servants for treatment, but they all directed me to You " Wretched are those who despair of Your mercy! Is there a chance of my being worthy of being cured by You?" God, Mighty and Majestic is He, asked him, "Did all those you approached guide You to Me?" He answered, "Yes", and God said, "Then go and give the sinners good tidings, and give warning to the veracious (ṣiddīqūn)." David was baffled and said, "Have I misunderstood or not?" He replied, "You are not mistaken." David asked, "How is that?" He said: "Give the sinners the good tidings that I am forgiving (ghafūr) and warn the veracious (ṣiddīqūn) that I am jealous (ghayūr)." He [Sahl] was asked, "Who are veracious?" He replied:They are those who combat their lower selves through the glorification (taṣbīḥ) and veneration(taqdīs) [of God]. Furthermore, they are those who keep their bodily limbs and senses in check. Hence, they become veracious in speech and action, veracious outwardly and inwardly, veracious in their involvement in anything and likewise in their disengagement from anything.

      <text>When God wishes to guide someone, He expands their breast to Islam"Sahl said:Truly God has distinguished between the one who seeks (murīd) and the one who is [divinely] sought (murād), even though they are both from Him (min ʿindihi). But He simply wanted to distinguish the elite (khuṣūṣ) from the generality (ʿumūm), and so He singled out the one who is sought (murād) in this sūra and others. He also mentioned the one who seeks (murīd), representing the generality, in this sūra in His words, Exalted is He: Do not drive away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance [6:52]. This is the servant"s being intent (qaṣd) upon God in his every moment of activity and stillness (fī ḥarakātihi wa sukūnihi), just as He also said: and those who hearken to their Lord and maintain the prayer" [42:38]. Thus, whoever finds that he has the state of both the seeker and the sought, that is due to a grace (faḍl) from God to him. Do you not see how He has brought them together in His words, Exalted is He: Whatever grace you have, it is from God [16:53]?He was asked, "Why are they [murīd and murād] separated then?" He said:The seeker who makes an effort to direct himself towards (qaṣd) God, Exalted is He, and to worship Him, and seeks the way to Him, is still in the state of seeking (ṭalab). As for the sought, it refers to the establishment of worship for him by God, Exalted is He. Man has within himself that which [shows him] to be both a seeker (murīd) and one who is sought (murād). At one time, ⸢he enters into his acts of obedience [applying to them] struggle (mukābada) and striving (mujāhada), and this is [when he is] at the level of the seeker (murīd), when he may be stirred [into action] (tuhayyijahu) by the inducement of hope (raghba), or by fear (rahba). Then at another time⸣, he finds himself carried through those acts without effort (taklīf) or striving (jahd), [and this is] a solicitude from God, Exalted is He, towards him. Then after that, he will move on to the highest stations (maqāmāt) and most elevated ranks (darajāt).[At this point] he was asked about the meaning of the stations (maqāmāt), and he replied:They are mentioned in the Book of God, Exalted is He, in the story about the angels, And there is not one of us but [that he] has a known station [37:164].</text>

Or in secret means the persistence (iṣrār) in committing that act, and this is of two kinds: the first is that a person commits a sin and persists in committing it; the other is that he persists in sin through desiring it in his heart, but he is not able to do it when he finds the opportunity because of a weakness in his bodily members, even though he is intent upon doing it. This is one of the most serious forms of persistence.Then Sahl said:Whoever eats what is permissible (ḥalāl) with gluttony is persistent (muṣirr), and whoever preoccupies himself with what the morrow may bring before the morrow arrives is persistent.He was asked about the prophets Â, regarding whether they thought about that which did not concern them.

Furthermore, his good deeds will not become pure as long as he maintainsjust one misdeed, until he repents and divests himself of that misdeed, thereby purifying them [his good deeds] from the defilement of sins [he commits], both in secret and openly.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

No one can exit the [sphere of] His omnipotence, Exalted is He. No one should feel free of fear, even if they [think] they have experienced all [possible] fear. However, once someone recognises his station (manzila) with God, Exalted is He, his knowledge will increase and his desire (raghba) will be fulfilled. But as for the one who does not know his station, that will be a source of shame (ʿār) for him.ʿUmar Wāṣil said that he then asked [Sahl], "How does a person"s station rise in accordance with his knowledge?" He answered:There are two [kinds of] men: there is the man who rises [in his spiritual station] and asks for [further] elevation, being avid for this; and then there is the man who is weaker than the other, whose [request] derives from gratitude, lest God should take back what He has given him.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

However, whoever has been denied understanding of the Qurʾān has been denied access to a great science (ʿilm ʿaẓīm)."

      <text>And remember when your Lord took from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seeds, and made them testify about themselves"He [Sahl] said:God, Exalted is He, took the prophets Â from the loins of Adam, and then He extracted from the back of each prophet his progeny in a molecular form [lit. in the shape of specks] possessingintellects (ʿuqūl). Then he took from the prophets their pledge (mīthāq), as is stated in His words, We took from the prophets their pledge: as (We did) from you and from Noah [33:7]. The Covenant that they were bound to was that they would convey from God, Exalted is He, His commandments and prohibitions. Then He called them all to affirm His lordship, with His words, Exalted is He: "Am I not your Lord?" Then He manifested His omnipotence [to them], so They said: "Yes, we testify" [7:172]. Thus did God gather what He wanted (murād) from His creatures, and the beginning and end that was in store for them in their saying "Yes", since this was in the manner of a trial (ibtilāʾ). Indeed, God, Exalted is He, said: And His Throne was upon the water, that He might try you [11:7]. He also made the prophets testify for themselves as a proof (ḥujjatan), as God, Exalted is He, has said, and made them testify concerning themselves. Then He returned them to the loins of Adam, and subsequently He sent the prophets to remind them of His Pact and Covenant. Furthermore, within His knowledge on the day when they affirmed what they affirmed, were those who would deny it and those who would verify it, and the last hour will not arrive until every person who made the Covenant has appeared.He was asked, "What are the signs of happiness (saʿāda) and wretchedness (shaqāwa)?" He said:Truly, among the signs of wretchedness is the denial of His omnipotence, and truly among the signs of happiness is the expansiveness of your heart in faith, your being provided with riches in your heart, protection in obedience, and success in renouncing [the world] (zuhd). Whoever is inspired with propriety (adab) in that which is between him and God, Exalted is He, will be purified of heart, and bestowed with happiness.</text>

He turned away [from God"s signs] due to his following his [base] desire (hawā). God, Exalted is He, distributed desire among the bodily members such that each bodily member has a portionof it. If one of the bodily members inclines towards that desire, its harm will return to the heart. Know that the self has a secret which did not manifest itself except with Pharaoh when he said: "I am your Lord most High" [79:24].Then [Sahl] was asked, "How can we be preserved from [base] desire (hawā)?" He replied:Whoever keeps himself in propriety (adab) will be preserved from it, for whoever subdues his lower self through propriety serves God, Mighty and Majestic is He, with true sincerity (ikhlāṣ).He also said:The self (nafs) has seven heavenly veils and seven earthly veils. The more the servant buries his [lower] self in the earth the higher will his heart soar heavenwards. Furthermore, if he [completely] buries his lower self beneath the earth his heart will reach the Throne. He also said about Kahmas that he used to pray a thousand rakʿas (cycles of prayer) during the course of the day and night.

      <text>Indeed God has purchased from the believers their selves and their possessions, so that theirs will be [the reward of] Paradise"That is, He has purchased [one"s] self from the desires of this world and from all that distracts it from remembrance of Him, so that one"s self and wealth may become solely devoted to Him. And how can anyone who has not sold his ephemeral life and fleeting desires to God, live with God, Exalted is He? Moreover how can he live a good life?Then he said:God has purchased from the believers their selves" notwithstanding the fact that there is no good in them, and He gave them in exchange that which is entirely good, even though all that is within the two realms of existence belongs to Him. Truly this is out of His utmost graciousness(luṭf) and generosity (karam) to His believing servants.Mālik b. Dīnār has related that he passed by a palace under construction and asked the workers about their wages. Each one replied by telling him how much his wage was except for one of them. So he asked him, "What is your wage?" He replied, "I don"t have a wage." He asked, "And why is that?" and he replied, "It is because I am the servant of the owner of the palace." Then Mālik ⸢cried out and⸣ said, "O my Lord! How generous you are! All humanity are your servants, yet you have assigned them work to do and promised them a reward for it."His words:</text>

      <text>Those who repent, those who worship...Sahl said:Of the rights [due to God] in this world there is none whose fulfilment is more incumbent upon humanity than repentance. Indeed it is obligatory [for them] at every moment and instant, and there is no punishment more severe on them than the lack of knowledge of repentance.He was asked, "What is repentance?" He answered, "It is not to forget your sin." Then he said:The first thing that a novice is instructed to do is to change his reprehensible actions into praiseworthy ones, which is repentance. [However] his repentance is not complete until he imposes silence upon himself, and his silence is not complete until he forces himself to observe seclusion (khalwa). His seclusion is not complete unless his food is lawful. His consumption of what is lawful, however, is not complete unless he fulfils the right of God, Exalted is He, and his fulfilment of what is God"s right is not complete unless he guards his bodily members and his heart. Moreover, none of that which we have described is acceptable unless [the novice] seeks God"s aid at every stage.He was asked, "What is the mark of true repentance?" He replied:Its mark is that a person gives up what is [rightfully] his in addition to what is not his.Sahl was [then] asked about a man who repents and renounces a certain sin, but then it occurs to his heart, or he sees it or hears of it and finds sweetness in that vile sin. What is to be done in such a case? He replied:The feeling of sweetness pertains to [his] nature (ṭabʿ) and is not susceptible of change, such that a thing which is loved could become something detestable. However, the heart"s determination can be coerced so that he can return to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and place his dilemma before Him. Then he should force on himself and on his heart a state of rejection [of that sin] which should never leave him, for if he becomes inattentive to that state of rejection for just the blinking of the eye, it is to be feared that he will not remain safe from it. He [also] said:Give up all idle talk (qāl wa qīl). In this day and age, there are three things which you must do: repent to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, from what you are aware of between yourselves and Him; as far as you are capable, make amends for wrongs done to servants; and when morning comes do not preoccupy yourselves with the evening, nor when evening comes preoccupy yourselves with the morning [that has been or is to come]. Misfortunes have multiplied and the danger is great. So fear God and coerce yourselves into a state of repentance.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>" a party from each group should go forth so that they may become learned in religionHe said:[That is], in order to learn what is necessary concerning their religion. It has been related from Ḥasan al-Baṣrī that he said, "The erudite (faqīh) is the one who has renounced this world (zāhid), who is desirous (rāghib) of the Hereafter, and who has insight (baṣīr) into religious affairs. Sahl was asked about the words of the Prophet, "Seeking knowledge is an obligation (farīḍa) for every Muslim". He said, "This refers to the knowledge of [one"s] state (ḥāl)."He was asked, "What is the knowledge of [one"s] state?" He replied:Inwardly it is sincerity (ikhlāṣ) and outwardly it is emulation (iqtidāʾ). Moreover, unless a person"s outward [self] (ẓāhir) is leading his inner [self] (bāṭin), and his inner self is the perfection(kamāl) of his outward self, he will merely be fatiguing his body. He was asked, "What is the explanation of this?" He said:Truly God keeps watch over you, in what you keep secret and what you make known, in your [moments of] movement and stillness, and you are never absent from Him even for the blinking of the eye, just as He has said, Is He who stands over every soul [observing] what it has earned? [13:33], and He has said, There is not a secret consultation between three, but He makes the fourth among them [58:7]. He has also said, We are nearer to him than [his] aorta (ḥabl al-warīd) [50:16]. This is the artery located deep inside the heart, and He has informed us that He is closer to the heart than that artery. If you know this you should feel shame before Him. Furthermore, whenever some craving from the lower self stirs itself in the heart, and [at that moment] the servant remembers that God, Mighty and Majestic is He, is watching over him, and subsequently abandons [that craving], knowledge of his state will enter his heart, such that if what he is granted were to be distributed among the people of Medina, all of them would rejoice at it, and would triumph because of it.

      <text>Assuredly God"s friends, no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve.Sahl said:They are those whom the Messenger of God described, saying, "When they are seen, God is remembered." They are those who strive in God"s cause, who outstrip others in their [journeying]towards Him, and whose actions are constantly in conformity (muwāfaqa). Those are the true believers [8:4].And he [Sahl] said:All goodness comes together in four things, and through these they [believers] become "Substitutes"(abdāl): an empty stomach, seclusion from people, the night vigil, and observing silence.He was asked why the Substitutes (abdāl) are called Substitutes. He answered:It is because they substitute their spiritual states (aḥwāl) [one for another]. They have submitted their bodies to the vigour (ḥīl) in their innermost secrets (asrār). Then they move from state (ḥāl) to state, and from knowledge (ʿilm) to knowledge, so that they are constantly increasing in the knowledge of that which is between them and their Lord.He was asked, "Who are more excellent, the Mainstays (awtād) or the Substitutes (abdāl)?" He answered, "The mainstays". Then he was asked, "And how is that?" He replied:It is because the Mainstays have already arrived and their principles (arkān) are well established, whereas the Substitutes move from state to state.[On this subject] Sahl also said:I have met with one thousand five hundred veracious [servants of God] (ṣiddīq) among whom were forty Substitutes (abdāl) and seven Mainstays (awtād), and I found their way (ṭarīqa) and method (madhhab) to be the same as that which I follow.Furthermore, he used to say, "I am the proof of God (ḥujjat Allāh) against you in particular and against the people in general."It was [Sahl"s] way and his conduct to be full of gratitude and remember [God] a great deal. He was also constant in observing silence and reflection. He would dispute little and was of a generous spirit. He led people through his good character, mercy and compassion for them, and by giving them good counsel. He held fast to the principle[s] (aṣl) [of religion] while putting into practice [the rules] that are derived from it (farʿ). Truly God filled his heart with light, and invested his speech with wisdom. He was among the best of Substitutes, and if we include him among the Mainstays he was the Axis (quṭb) around which the millstone [of the world] revolves.</text>

      <text>He who desires the life of this world and its adornment, We shall repay them their deeds...Whoever aspires by his actions (ʿamal) to [attain] something other than God, will be granted by God the reward of his actions in this world, but there will remain nothing for him in the Hereafter. For such a person does not devote his actions purely to God, due to his desire for [having] a position in this world. If he but knew that God has placed the world and its people at the service of those who desire the Hereafter, he would not be ostentatious about his acts.Sahl was asked, "What is the hardest thing for the lower self (nafs)?" He replied, "Sincerity (ikhlāṣ)." He was asked why this was so, and he said, "It is because the lower self cannot have a share in it." He was asked, "Does ostentation (riyāʾ) penetrate the obligatory acts?" He replied:Yes, it may even penetrate faith, which is at the root of obligatory acts, so that [faith itself] is falsified and becomes hypocrisy. So how then will the acts be? Anyone whose outward conduct is not found fault with by a single person but whose real state in his inner self God knows to be the contrary, is being ostentatious without a doubt.

However, He made the gushing forth of the wellsprings of the heart of Muḥammad with the lights of knowledge of differentkinds a [sign of] mercy for his nation, because God, Exalted is He, honoured him with this honour. For the light of the prophets Â is from his [Muḥammad"s] light, the light of the heavenly dominions is from his light and the light of this world and the Hereafter is from his light. Whoever truly desires [God"s] love must follow him. God said to His Prophet : Say: "If you love God, follow me, and God will love you" [3:31]. Thus has He made love [consist] of following him [the Prophet], and has made the reward for His servants who follow him His love, which is the highest honour (aʿlā al-karāma).It is related on the authority of Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī that he said: "While we were with the Messenger of God, he approached us and [turned to] face us as if he wished to tell us something.Then he fell into prostration and we prostrated with him at the beginning of the day until around midday, such that some of us could taste the earth through our noses and we remarked to each other, "The Messenger of God has died." But then he raised his head and said, "God is Great!", so we said, "God is Great!". Then someone said to him, "O Messenger of God, we thought you had died and if that had been the case we would not have cared if the sky fell onto the earth."

Thus, when he remembers it [that knowledge], he sighs, and keeps silent regarding the question of the knowledge of his end (khātima), since he has no [power of] choosing (ikhtiyār) with God, Mighty and Majestic is He.Then Sahl said:Fear is male and hope is female, and if one iota of the fear of the fearful (khāʾifūn) were divided among the inhabitants of the earth, they would all attain eternal happiness by it.Then he was asked, "If that is so, how much fear do the fearful have?"

      <text>"Yet I do not exculpate my own soul; verily the soul is ever inciting to evil"" He [Sahl] said:Truly, the [evil-]inciting self (nafs ammāra) is lust (shahwa), which is the role played by man"s [basic] nature (ṭabʿ); ""unless my Lord shows mercy", is the role played by the [divine] protection (ʿiṣma). The self at peace (nafs muṭmaʾinna) is the self of gnosis (nafs al-maʿrifa). God, Exalted is He, created the self and made ignorance its nature (ṭabʿ) and made desire (hawā) the closest thing to it. He also made desire the door by which man"s ruin enters.Sahl was asked about the meaning of [a person"s] nature (ṭabʿ) and how one might necessarily acquire protection from it. He said:Human nature (ṭabʿ) comprises four natural dispositions (ṭabāʾiʿ): the first is the animal disposition(ṭabʿ al-bahāʾim), that of the stomach and genitals; the second is the satanic disposition (ṭabʿ al-shayāṭīn), that of play (laʿb) and diversion (lahw); the third is the sorcerous disposition (ṭabʿ al-saḥara), that of delusion (makr) and deception (khidāʿ); and the fourth is the devilishnature (ṭabʿ al-abālisa), that of refusal (ibāʾ) and arrogance (istikbār). [Divine] protection (ʿiṣma) against the animal disposition is through faith (īmān). Safety (salāma) from the satanic disposition is through glorification (tasbīḥ) and sanctification [of God] (taqdīs), which is the natural disposition of angels. Safety from the sorcerous disposition is through truthfulness (ṣidq), sincere counsel (naṣīḥa), equity (inṣāf) and graciousness (tafaḍḍul). Safety from the devilish nature is through taking refuge (iltijāʾ) in God, Exalted is He, by humbly imploring him (taḍarruʿ) and crying out to Him (ṣarākh). The nature of the intellect (ʿaql) is to have knowledge but the nature of the lower self (nafs) is ignorance. The natural disposition of [human] nature is [to make] pretentious claims (daʿwā).His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>"until you are consumed It was related from ʿAlī that he said, "The word ḥaraḍ means affliction due to pain in the heart."Ibn ʿAbbās y said, "Ḥaraḍ is [severe sickness] close to death. Sahl said:It means being impaired (fāsid) in body and in deed because of grief. His grief was only on account of Joseph"s religion and not for the sake of [Joseph] himself, for he knew that if he died upon his religion he would be united with him in the Hereafter that is everlasting, but if he changed his religion they would never be united ever again. It was related from Sufyān that he said, "Verily when the one bringing good tidings [of Joseph] came to Jacob, he asked him, "What was his religion when you left him?" He replied, "It was the religion of submission to God (islām)." So Jacob said, "Now the blessing is complete.""His words, Exalted is He:</text>

For he asked himself, "How great would be the feelings I would experience if I were to be separated from God, Mighty and Majestic is He, when separation from a creature had caused me to act in such a way?" So he complained of his distraction and anguish to God, Exalted is He, and to no one else.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>"And do not despair of God"s [gracious] spirit"The best and highest form of service (khidma) is waiting for relief (intiẓār al-faraj) from God, Exalted is He, as it has been related from Ibn ʿUmar y that the Prophet said: "Waiting for relief with patience is worship (ʿibāda)." The relief for which one waits is of two kinds: one is close (qarīb) and the other distant (baʿīd). That which is close is in the secret that is between the servant and his Lord. That which is distant relates to [that which is between] people, and whoever looks to [relief that is] far away is veiled from what is close at hand. His words, Exalted is He:</text>

What is meant is: "Let me die as one who has committed his affairs over to You and handed over his concerns to You, so that I have no recourse to my lower self under any condition, and do not resort to managing things [for myself] (tadbīr) by means of any secondary cause (sabab) whatsoever.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

This is the inner meaning of the verse. However, the outer meaning of the verse refers to the fact that the polytheists among the Arabs believe in God, just as He has said, If you ask them, who created them, they will certainly say "God""[43:87] Even so they are polytheists who believe in some of the messengers but do not believe in others.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

He said:Whoever is assiduous in his quest, but finds his assiduity (jidd) is met by an impediment (manʿ) from You, will not be benefitted by striving in his quest.And he said:For sure, the inner truth [or secret, sirr] has not been revealed to people, for if it were disclosed to them then they would have perceived it. Nor have they witnessed [it], for if they had witnessedit, the whole matter would be over, and that is a grave matter. Then he [Sahl] said:The People of "There is no God but God" are many but the sincere among them are few. But God knows best.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

Their speech is thunder and their laughter is lightning."" Abū Bakr said that he asked him, "What would you say regarding a day on which there is a heavy downpour and the sound of the thunder is violent?"

      <text>"Truly, it is in the remembrance of God that hearts find peace.[In] remembrance (dhikr) with knowledge (ʿilm) there is tranquil repose (sukūn), and [in] remembrance with intellect (ʿaql) there is profound peace (ṭumaʾnīna). He [Sahl] was asked, "And how is that?" He replied:If a servant is maintaining [true] obedience to God, he will be in a state of remembrance (dhākir), but when something occurs to his mind, he will be in a state of severance (qāṭiʿ) [from God]. If he is involved in an act [motivated by] his lower self, and something comes to his heart which guides him to remembrance and obedience, this is the role played by the intellect (mawḍiʿ al-ʿaql).Then he said:Anyone who claims to practise remembrance falls into one of two types. There are those whom the fear of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, never leaves, but who also experience love (ḥubb) and fervour (nashāṭ) in their hearts. They are truly people of remembrance and they live for God, the Hereafter, knowledge and the Sunna. Then there are those who claim to be in a state of fervour, joy and happiness in every situation.

      <text>Have you not seen how God has coined a similitude? A goodly saying is as a goodly tree; its roots set firm and its branches in heaven.He replied:It was related from Ibn ʿAbbās y that the Prophet went out to his Companions while they were discussing the "goodly tree", and he said: "That is the believer whose root is in the earth and whose branch is in heaven." This means that his works are raised to the heavens and accepted. This is the similitude that God coined for the believer and the disbeliever. So He said, A goodly saying, that is, a saying of sincerity (ikhlāṣ), is as a goodly tree, that is, the date palm; its roots set firm and its branches in heaven, that is, its branches rise up to heaven. Likewise the root of the works of a believer are in the saying [which attests to] God"s oneness (kalimat al-tawḥīd), which is a firm root whose branches, his works, are raised up to the heavens and accepted, unless there is some deficiency or ill-effect (iḥdāth) in them. However, even then the root of his actions, namely the saying which attests to God"s oneness, is not removed, just as the winds shake the branches of the date palm, but its root remains firmly in place.He likened the actions of a disbeliever to a foul tree (shajara khabītha), saying but an evil saying is as a bad tree [14:26], meaning the colocynth tree (ḥanẓal). It is the foulest on the earth, for it has no roots at all beneath it. Just so is disbelief and hypocrisy, which have no endurance in the Hereafter. Thus, in the treasure houses of God, there is nothing greater than the attestation of God"s oneness (tawḥīd).Sahl was asked about the meaning of "There is no god save God" (lā ilāha illā"Llāh). He said: "There is no bestower of benefit (nāfiʿ) and no defender (dāfiʿ) except God, Exalted is He."He was asked about islām, īmān and iḥsān. He answered:Islām is the law (ḥukm), īmān is the bond [with God] (waṣl) and iḥsān is the reward (thawāb); and for that reward there is a reward.</text>

Ibn ʿAbbās y said, "Kulla ḥīn means morning and night."

      <text>Leave them to eat and enjoy [themselves]. Let them be diverted by [false] hope; for they will come to know.He [Sahl] said:If four [traits] come together in a servant, it will be said to him, "Truly, you will not attain anythingin this affair": if he likes to eat tasty food, dress in fine clothes, see his command executed and his possessions increase. Of such a one it will be said, "Alas, this is the one who was cut off from God, Exalted is He, by the creation." It has been related that God revealed to David the following: "Caution and warn your companions about the gratification [lit. consuming, akl] of one"s carnal desires (shahawāt), for verily if hearts are attached to the desires of this world, their intellects (ʿuqūl) will be veiled from Me." Sahl [then] said:Hope (amal) is the soil of every transgression (maʿṣiya); cupidity (ḥirṣ) is the seed of every transgression, and procrastination (taswīf) is the water of every transgression. Strength (qudra) is the soil of every act of obedience (ṭāʿa), certainty (yaqīn) is the seed of every act of obedience and action (ʿamal) is the water of every act of obedience.He [probably Abū Bakr al-Sijzī] said:Sahl used to intensify his ecstasy (wajd) for seventy days, during which he would not eat anything, while he would order his companions to eat meat once a week so that they would not become too weak for worship. However for him, when he ate he would become weak, and when he became hungry he would gain in strength. He would sweat during the severe cold of winter while wearing only one shirt. If they asked him a question on knowledge he would say, "Don"t ask me questions, for you cannot benefit from my speech at this time." ʿAbbās b. ʿIṣām came one day while Sahl was saying, "For thirty years I have been speaking to God while people imagine that I"m speaking to them."

He said:He inspires him to seek forgiveness for his shortcomings and show gratitude for blessings he has received. Truly, they desired with a [wholehearted] intention that they should come to know of the blessings that God, Exalted is He, had bestowed on them, that [their state of] gratitude might endure, and the increase [resulting from that gratitude] might continue.</text>
      <text>"Then when misfortune befalls you, to Him you cry for help.That is, to Him alone do you call in times of deprivation (faqr) and affliction (balāʾ). [Moreover] this may [itself] be a blessing from God upon you, for if He so wished He could have afflicted you with something severer than that, so in comparison to a severer affliction, it is a blessing, for [under a severer affliction] they would recoil in fear from it, and neither exercise patience (ṣabr) nor show gratitude.It came to our knowledge that God, Exalted is He, revealed to David the words: "Be patient with the provisions (maʾūna) you have [from Me], and you will be granted help (maʿūna) from Me".

This verse is also a severe warning to those who are heedless (ghāfilūn), in accordance with the saying of the Messenger : "Whoever gratifies his insatiable desire (nahma) in this world, will, in the Hereafter, be separated from [the objectof] his desire. For that which was legitimate, there will be an accounting (ḥisāb), and for that which was forbidden, there will be punishment (ʿiqāb)." Indeed, the believers are made to account for what they enjoyed legitimately in excess of their needs. Whoever takes of what is legitimate [only] that which suffices him, falls under the category mentioned by the Prophet when he said, "Worldliness is not in the consumption of a piece of dry bread by which a person abates his hunger, a garment by which he covers his private parts and carries out what is legally binding upon him, or a house which shelters him from the sun and cold in winter."

He replied, "We were with such and such a person who informed us that intoxication is of four kinds." He said, "Tell me what they are."

Then they struggledto keep themselves in the company of the people of goodness (khayr). Subsequently, they were steadfast in this and did not go back to the situation they were in at the beginning of events.Once a man asked Sahl, "I have wealth and strength and I want to perform jihād.

Do you not see that God, Exalted is He, says, And man prays for ill as [avidly] as he prays for good? The one who remembers [God] constantly, and who abandons choice (ikhtiyār), supplication (duʿāʾ) and petitioning (suʾāl), will be granted the best that could be desired, and the ills of petitioning and choice will fall away from him.

Or else, prepare to have the Fire as your cloak." ʿUmar said: "Call yourselves to account before you are called to account. Weigh yourselves up before you are weighed up, and prepare for the great [Day of] Exposure before you are exposed." Sahl was asked about the calling to account (muḥāsaba) and the weighing up (muwāzana). He said:The calling to account is of two kinds: the accounting that concerns those matters which are between the servant and his Lord, and this is in secret; and the accounting that concerns matters that are between him and other people, and that is done openly. The weighing up is when you have before you [the possibility of] two obligatory acts, two Sunna acts, or two supererogatory acts (nafl).

Ḥasan al-Baṣrī said, "The awwāb is the penitent who repents without delay. Indeed he is ready (muhayyaʾ) for repentance at every instant and moment." It was related on the authority of Ḍamra b.

      <text>Gardens of Eden, which the Compassionate One has promised to His servants in the unseen"This means the "visual" beholding (muʿāyana) of God, in the sense of nearness which He appointed between Him and them, so that the servant sees his heart in the proximity of God, witnessed (mashhūd) in the unseen of the unseen (ghayb al-ghayb). The unseen of the unseen is the spiritual self (nafs al-rūḥ), the understanding of the intellect (fahm al-ʿaql), and the discernmentof meaning by the heart (fiṭnat al-murād bi"l-qalb). The spiritual self is the seat of the intellect (ʿaql), which is the seat of the Holy (al-Quds). This Holy is linked with the Throne (ʿarsh), and is one of the names of the Throne. God, Exalted is He, apportioned for the self one part in a thousand parts [i.e. one thousandth] of the spirit (rūḥ) " or rather, even less than that. When the will (irāda) of the spirit becomes the will of the self (nafs) [as in the spiritual self], they are given between them discernment (fiṭna) and intuition (dhihn). Discernment is the guide (imām) of understanding (fahm), and understanding is the guide of intuition (dhihn). Discernment (fiṭna) is life (ḥayāt) and understanding (fahm) is livelihood (ʿaysh).There are but two [kinds of] men who understand the Word [of God]: the first wants to understand so he can speak about it from a position [of authority] and his lot is nothing but that; the other hears it and is occupied with acting upon it to the exclusion of all else. This person is rarer than red sulphur (al-kibrīt al-aḥmar) and more precious than all that is dear. He is among those who love one another for God"s sake (al-mutaḥābbūn fī"Lllāh). Trying to understand (tafahhum) is an exertion of effort (takalluf), yet discernment (fiṭna) cannot be attained through effort, but rather by acting in sincerity (al-ʿamal bi"l-ikhlāṣ) for Him. Truly God, Exalted is He, has servants in Paradise who, if they were veiled from the encounter (liqāʾ) [with their Lord] for a blinking of the eye, would cry out for help against it, just as the inhabitants of the Hellfire plead for help against the Hellfire. This is because they have come to know Him (ʿarafūhu).

      <text>Have you not seen that We unleash the devils against the disbelievers to urge them on impetuously?He said:They arouse them, stirring them up to acts of disobedience (maʿāṣī) and they call them to those transgressions by means of that which their lower self desires, due to the abandonment of God"s protection, just as God, Exalted is He, has said in the story of the Accursed One [Satan] (al-Laʿīn): I had no power over you except to call you, and you responded to my call [14:22]. His calling is at different levels. It may be to what is evil or it may be to what is good, just as the Prophet said, "Truly Satan will show one of you seventy doors to goodness just in order to make him enter one door to evil and thereby ruin him."He [Sahl] continued:Indeed, the Accursed One whispers to all those who perform acts of worship (ahl al-ʿibādāt) and strive [for the good] (aṣḥāb al-jahd), but he has no concern for them; his concern is rather for the one who does not enter into anything without knowing whether it is [spiritually] to his benefit or detriment. It is only with regard to knowledge that worshippers and renunciants (zuhhād) fall into errors, not because of their striving, for [regarding the latter] they do not possess a state in which they might discern [errors] in their relationship with God. When God, Exalted is He, calls a servant to account on the Day of Resurrection, his intellect will remain firm with regard to every action that was done with the knowledge of whether he was in a state of obedience or transgression. However, he will fall into confusion (taḥayyur) and bewilderment (dahsha) on account of whatever he did in a state of ignorance (jahl). This is because, when he knows what state (ḥāl) he is in, his obedience and repentance (tawba) will be acceptable through God"s proof (ḥujja). However, if he does not know [his state] he will fall into confusion and bewilderment, because he acted without anything that could act as proof [for him before God]. Sahl was asked concerning the man who is in a state of remembering God, and the thought (khaṭar) "God is with you" occurs to his heart. He said:It [the thought] is one of three things: it is either an enemy who wishes to cut him off [from God], or his lower self wanting to betray him, or his lower self trying to deceive him. In this case, he should not pay any attention to such thoughts (khawāṭir). His words, Exalted is He:</text>

Indeed, when God created the heart He said, "I have created you especially for Me." Thus, these hearts are wanderers (jawwāla); they either circumambulate the Throne, or they wander [aimlessly] in the dry fodder (ḥashsh) [of the desert wilderness.] His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>"I also have other uses for it. The first one to own the staff was Adam. It came from a myrtle tree in Paradise. Then it was passed down from prophet to prophet until it came to Shuʿayb. Subsequently, when [Shuʿayb] gave Moses his daughter in marriage, he presented the staff to him. Moses used to lean on it, drive his sheep with it, scatter leaves for his sheep with it; then he would take from the tree whatever he wanted with it, and he would send it after lions, wild beasts and the vermin of the earth and it would strike them. If the heat became intense, he would stick it in the ground upright and it would provide shade. When he slept, it would guard over him until he awoke, and if the night was pitch dark, it would light up for him like a torch. When it was a cloudy day and he could not tell the time for prayer, it would give off rays from one of its sides. If he became hungry he would plant it in the earth and it would bear fruit immediately. These were the uses of his staff. Moses mentioned the benefits and uses of the staff that had appeared to him, but God, Exalted is He, intended [to draw his attention to] uses and benefits [of the staff] that were, as yet, hidden from him, such as its turning into a snake, or [Moses"] striking the rock with it so that the springs gushed forth from it, or his striking the sea with it, and other such uses. It was through this that He showed him that the knowledge of people, even when they are supportedby prophecy (nubuwwa), is deficient when compared to God"s knowledge regarding the universe of created things.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

However, He did not will for him [Pharaoh] faith (īmān), for had He willed it, He would have said, "So he may believe."

      <text>And [mention] Job, when he called out to his Lord, "Indeed, harm has befallen me""He said:Suffering (ḍurr) is of two kinds: outward suffering (ẓāhir) and inward suffering (bāṭin). The inward kind is a commotion (ḥaraka) and perturbation (iḍṭirāb) [within] the soul (nafs) inresponse to a moving emotional experience (wārid). The outward kind is when [the emotion] that is concealed in a person becomes outwardly apparent. [However], when what is being suffered inwardly settles [within a person, his] exterior becomes still and does not show it, and he patiently endures those pains. But when the interior (bāṭin) becomes unsettled (taḥarraka) under the influence of the [emotional] experience, the person"s exterior will be shaken into weeping and loud cries. His [Job"s] plea to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, is that He grant him assistance in finding acceptance (riḍā) in his heart for that experience. This is because as long as the heart is accepting of God"s command, the servant will not be harmed by his outward reaction. Just consider the instance of the Prophet"s weeping. Note that when he wept on the death of his son Ibrāhīm, he wept for him out of compassion in accordance with his human nature. Yet his physical response did not harm him because his heart was accepting (rāḍin) of it.Sahl used to say to his companions:Say in your supplication (duʿāʾ): "O my Lord, if you cook me, I"ll bear it and if you roast me, I"ll be happy. It is essential that You be known, so favour me with gnosis (maʿrifa) of You."He was asked about the abode (dār), whether it was an abode of Islam or disbelief. He replied, "The abode is the abode of tribulation (balāʾ) and testing (ikhtibār)." ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Marwazī asked Sahl, "What do you say of a man whose lower self has been calling him to satiate it on the leaves of a lotus tree (sidr) for eighteen days?" Sahl answered, "What do you say of a man whose lower self has been calling him to let him just catch the scent of the leaves of a lotus tree ⸢for twenty-five days⸣?"

Ḥasan said, "He called it Ancient (ʿatīq) to honour it, just as the Arabs speak of an "ancient" body, and an "ancient" horse if it is noble." My maternal uncle, Muḥammad b. Sawwār, related on the authority of al-Thawrī that he said, "It is called this because it is the oldest (aqdam) and most ancient (aʿtaq) place of worship belonging to God, just as He said: The first House (of worship) to be established for people was that at Bakka, a blessed place [3:96]."Some have said, "He [God] called it ʿatīq because no tyrant ever headed for it with an evil design without God"s destroying him and freeing (aʿtaqa) His House from him. Some have said, "It is because it was saved (uʿtiqa) from being submerged during the great flood and raised to the sky." Just as God has freed His House, so He has also freed the heart of the believer from other [than Him]. It [the Kaʿba] is older than anything else that God, Exalted is He, erected on His earth as a sign (ʿalam), and He placed it within the Sacred Mosque (al-Masjid al-Ḥarām). Likewise the heart has [within it] another heart, which is the position from which the servant stands before his Master without being agitated or busied by anything, but in a state of tranquil repose in Him (sākin ilayhi).His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>We did not send before you any Messenger or prophet but that when he recited [the scripture]Satan cast [something] into his recitation"He said:That is, if he recites [the Scripture] and his lower self notices the recitation, Satan casts [somethinginto it], for he has a partnership with the lower self in this, and that noticing of the recitation comes from the desire of the lower self and its lust. However, if [the person reciting] then witnesses the One remembered (madhkūr) instead of the remembrance [itself] (dhikr), the heart will become oblivious of it [the recitation], and he will not witness anything besides his Master. Consequently Satan will become one of his captives. Do you not see how if a servant is inattentive (sahā) in his recitation (qirāʾa) or in his remembrance of his Lord, Mighty andMajestic is He, his heart acquiesces in the basest pleasures (huẓūẓ) of his lower self and thus can the Enemy [Satan] get at him. Ḥasan said, "The whispering (waswās) is of two kinds, one of which is from the lower self and the other from Satan. That which persists in coming is from the lower self, and assistance against it is sought through fasting, prayer and propriety (adab). However, that which [comes, but then] withdraws (nabdhan) is from Satan, and assistance against it is sought through the recitation of the Qurʾān and remembrance [of God] (dhikr)."His words:</text>

      <text>Indeed, prosperous are the believers,! those who in their prayers are humbly submissive (khāshiʿūn),[Sahl was asked], "What is humble submission?" He replied:Humble submission (khushūʿ) is openly [manifested] (ʿalāniyya). It is to stand before God, Exalted is He, while maintaining the conditions for the finest conduct (ādāb) required by the One who commands (al-Āmir), which is to purge your [moments of] activity (ḥarakāt) and stillness (sukūn) from anything other than Him. The root of this is fear (khashiya) within the innermost secret (sirr). If a person is given fear, humble submission will manifest in his exterior and this is one of the conditions of [true] faith.It has been related of Ḥasan b. ʿAlī y that when he finished his ablutions, the colour of his face would change and he was asked about that. He said, "It is appropriate that the face of the one who intends to enter the presence of the Master of the Throne [God] should change colour." It is related of the Prophet that he said to Muʿādh, "Truly, the Qurʾān has curbed (qayyada) the believer from much of what his lower self desires, and by God"s permission has come between him and his being ruined by that desire. Indeed, the believer is a captive to whomsoever has a rightful claim over him. O Muʿādh! The believer strives to liberate himself. O Muʿādh! Truly a believer"s fear will not abate, nor his unrest be stilled until he leaves behind him the Traverse over Hell. O Muʿādh! Truly the believer knows that there are observers keeping watch over his hearing, sight, tongue, hands, feet, stomach and genitals, and even the blinking of his eye, the particles of mud on his fingers, the kohl in his eyes and every movement he makes. Mindfulness of God (taqwā) is his companion (rafīq), the Qurʾān is his guide (dalīl), fear (khawf) is his way (maḥajja), longing (shawq) is his riding beast (maṭiyya), dread (wajl) is his emblem (shiʿār), prayer (ṣalāt) is his cave [of refuge] (kahf), fasting (ṣiyām) is his garden [or Paradise] (janna), charity (ṣadaqa) is his source of liberation (fikāk), truthfulness (ṣidq) is his vizier, shame (ḥayāʾ) is his emir, and behind all of these, his Lord is on the look out (bi-mirṣād). O Muʿādh! I wish for you what I wish for myself. I have forbidden you that which Gabriel forbade me. I do not know anyone at all who will join me on the Day of Resurrection and who will be happier than you at what God has granted you." His words:</text>

The intellect [is a veil] in its preoccupation with the management of the affairsof this world (tadbīr al-dunyā); knowledge because of the vainglory (mubāhāt) [it breeds] among peers; the heart in its heedlessness (ghafla); fear because of its disregard for influxes [of grace from above] (bi-ighfālihā ʿan mawārid al-umūr ʿalayhā) ; the self because it is the haven (maʾwā) for every tribulation (baliyya); the will because it is directed towards this world and turned away from the Hereafter; the wish due to its pursuance of sins.His words:</text>

Indeed our predecessors used to take full advantage of this [admonition], such that it is related of Ḥudhayfa that he said, "Truly, the most delightful day for me is the day on which I return home and my family complains to me of their need.

The Messenger of God used to observe seclusion (khalwa) for the sake of the knowledge that God had opened to his heart, for he liked to reflect upon it.Everything will befriend the person whose prayer is good. Such a person will be stirred during sleep at the prayer times so that he awakes. This is done by his brothers among the jinn who have befriended him. They may also accompany him when he travels and give him priority over themselves. The angels may even befriend him. Once a man made a request from Sahl saying, "I really want to keep your company." He said, "When one of us dies, let whomsoever keeps company with the one who survives, keep his company from then on." Al-Rabīʿ b.

      <text>Or [is] He who answers the destitute one when he calls to Him [better]...? [Sahl] was asked, "Who is the destitute one (muḍṭarr)?" He replied:It is the person who, when he raises his hands [in prayer], does not see himself having any good deeds other than the profession of [God"s] oneness (tawḥīd), and even considers himself in danger [of losing that]. On another occasion he said:The destitute person (muḍṭarr) is the one who has washed his hands of all power (ḥawl), strength (quwwa) and reprehensible means (asbāb madhmūma). Supplication (daʿwa) from mankind is of two kinds, and is answered, without doubt, whether it be from a believer or unbeliever: the supplication of the destitute (muḍṭarr) and the supplication of the oppressed (maẓlūm); for God says, Exalted is He: Or [is] He who answers the destitute one when he calls to Him" [better]?, and He also says, and who provides for you from the heavens and [from] the earth [27:64]. The supplication of the oppressed is raised above the veil, and God, Exalted is He, responds with the words; "By My glory and majesty, I will come to your aid though it may be after a while."

      <text>Say, "No one in the heavens or on earth knows the unseen, except God..."He said:He [God] has concealed His unseen [mystery] (ghayb) from creatures (makhlūqūn) in His [realm of] dominion (jabarūt), lest any of His servants feel secure from His ruse (makr). Thus, no one knows what has been predestined for him by God, lest their concern be with deluding themselves (īhām) concerning the final outcomes (ʿawāqib) and predestined events (majārī al-sawābiq), and, lest they claim for themselves that of which they are not worthy, such as claims of [having attained the station of] love (maḥabba), gnosis (maʿrifa) and so on.He said:There were in Jerusalem (Bayt al-Maqdis) a hundred thousand veracious ones (ṣiddīqūn) publicly known to people, such that the sound of water flowing from the roof gutters could not be heard due to the [noise] of those who were making their spiritual devotions at night [lit. spiritually striving (mujtahidūn)]. But when two things appeared [from them] they asked God, Exalted is He, and He caused them to die. They were: the claim to love (maḥabba) and claim to have trust [in Him] (tawakkul). He was asked about the saying of al-Ḥārith, who stated, "I stay up at night and thirst during the day." He replied:He means, "I have no need for disclosure (kashf) for this is the lot of the disbelievers in this life, and I do not share with them their lot. This is why I said, "I am a believer"". He [Sahl] was asked about those who say something similar to that which was said by al-Ḥārith. He replied:Their claim is false. How can their claim be acceptable when Abū Bakr and ʿUmar y did not allow themselves to do such a thing, and a hair on their chests is better than al-Ḥārith. However, al-Ḥārith did not say that by himself, rather God brought that out [of him] as a test (fitna) for all those pretentious people (muddaʿūn) who came after him. So how then is it acceptable for these people to claim such things for themselves?His words, Exalted is He:</text>

The fortunate person is he who averts his eye from [looking upon] his states and acts; ⸢to him is opened⸣ the way of receiving grace (faḍl) and being gracious to [others] (ifḍāl), whilst keeping sight of God"s favour in [the accomplishment of] all acts. The wretched person, on the other hand, is the one who makes himself, his states (aḥwāl) and his deeds beautiful [in his eyes], to the point where he becomes proud of them, and then claims [responsibility for] them himself. His disgrace will ruin him one day if it does not ruin him in the present. See how God spoke of Korah with His words: I have been given it [this wealth] because of knowledge I possess, that is, merit (faḍl). This was because he was the most learned among them with regard to the Torah. He claimed merit for himself and so God made the earth beneath him swallow him up. This is the outer meaning [of the verse]. But just how many a person has sunk low through vices (ashrār), whilst being quite unaware of [what he is doing]. Sinking low [through] vices means a person"s being deprived of [divine] protection (ʿiṣma) and being left to his own power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa), so that his tongue is loosened and he starts to utter great claims. It also means he will be blind to God"s favour, and fail to show gratitude for what he has been given. At this point it will be time for [his] demise.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>Alif Lām Mīm! Do people suppose they will be left to say, "We believe," without being put to the test?He said:That is, without their being beset by affliction (balāʾ). Truly affliction is a doorway between the people of gnosis (ahl al-maʿrifa) and God, Mighty and Majestic is He. It has been related that the angels say, "O Lord! Your disbelieving servant has had [the goods of] this world made available to him in abundance, while affliction has been kept away from him." Then He says to the angels, "Reveal his [the unbelieving servant"s] punishment to them [the other angels?]." When they see it they say, "What he gets from the world is not a blessing for him." Then they say, "O Lord! You keep the world away from Your believing servant and expose him to affliction!" And He says to the angels, "Reveal to the others his [the believing servant"s] reward." When they see his reward they say, "Whatever he suffers in this world will not harm him." He [Tustarī] said:Let your prayer (ṣalāt) be forbearance (ṣabr) in the face of suffering (baʾsāʾ), your fasting (ṣawm) be to observe silence (ṣamt), and your charity (ṣadaqa) be to refrain from doing harm [to anybody] (kaff al-adhā). Furthermore, forbearance in [times of] well-being (ʿāfiya) is more difficult than forbearance in [times of] affliction (balāʾ).

The creature has no knowledge of God beyond that. This allusion (ishāra) [to similitudes in the verse] was made due to the fact that their hearts are truly far away from knowledge [of God].

      <text>Corruption has appeared on land and sea"He said:God, Exalted is He, has made the land a similitude of the bodily members and the sea a similitudeof the heart. It [the sea, and therefore the heart] is more widely beneficial (aʿamm nafʿan), and much more dangerous (akthar khaṭaran). This is the inner meaning of the verse " do you not see that the heart (qalb) was thus named due to its tendency to turn (taqallub), and due to the extent of its depth (ghawr). This is why the Prophet said to Abū al-Dardāʾ, "Overhaul the ship, for the sea is deep." In other words, "Make afresh your intention (nīya) for God, Exalted is He, from your heart, for the sea is deep." Therefore [with this renewed intention(nīya)], when the trafficking (muʿāmala) goes on in the hearts, which [as we have seen] are [like] seas, the self will leave its place at the centre, and the bodily members will come torest. Thereafter, with each day, the possessor of [the sea of the heart] will find himself closer to its ultimate depth and further away from his self until he reaches ⸢Him⸣. He was asked about the meaning of the [saying of] the Prophet, "Whoever humbles himself before a person of wealth will lose two thirds of his religion." He replied:The heart has three stations: the principal part (jumhūr) of the heart; the station of the tongue in relationship to the heart, and the station of the bodily members in relationship to the heart. His words, "has lost two thirds of his religion" means that two out of the three were involved, the tongue and the rest of the bodily members, but the principal part of the heart remained in its place, for no one can reach that because it is the seat of his faith (īmān) within the heart.Then he said:Truly, the heart is delicate (raqīq) and everything affects it, so guard over it carefully, and fear God with it.He was asked, "When does the heart become purified of all corruption (fasād) ?" He replied:It does not become purified until it abandons all conjecture (ẓann) and scheming (ḥiyal) " for it is as if scheming in the eyes of your Lord is [as bad] as a major sin to our eyes.</text>

      <text>God has not placed two hearts inside any man"He said:The one who has directed himself to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and is intent upon (qaṣdan) [Him], [does not] avert his gaze (iltifāt) [from Him]. For whoever pays attention to anything other than God is not truly intent upon his Lord. Indeed God, Exalted is He, says, God has not placed two hearts inside any man"It has been said:[That is, he does not have] one heart (qalb) with which he approaches God, and another heart with which he manages the affairs of this world. [On the other hand], the intellect (ʿaql) does have two natures (ṭabʿān): a nature which is orientated towards this world, and a nature which is orientated towards the Hereafter. The nature which is orientated to the Hereafter is in coalition (mūʾtalif) with the spiritual self (nafs al-rūḥ), whereas [the intellect"s] worldly-orientated nature is in coalition with the lustful self (nafs shahwāniyya). It was due to this that the Prophet [prayed], "Do not leave me to my self for the blinking of an eye." For truly the servant, ⸢as long as he is occupied with God, will be veiled from himself, and⸣ as long as he is occupied with himself will be veiled from God, Mighty and Majestic is He.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>so that He may question the truthful (ṣādiqīn) about their veracity. And he has prepared for those who disbelieve a painful chastisement. ʿAbd al-Wāḥid b. Zayd said:Veracity (ṣidq) is being faithful (wafāʾ) to God in your act[s].Sahl was asked about veracity and said:Veracity is fear concerning [our] end (khātima), and patience (ṣabr) is the proof [lit. witness (shāhid)] of veracity. Truly, veracity is hard for the veracious (ṣiddīqūn), sincerity (ikhlāṣ) is hard for the sincere (mukhliṣūn), and repentance (tawba) is hard for the repentant (tāʾibūn), for these three require [extraordinary] exertion of the spirit (badhl al-rūḥ). Aḥmad b. Mattā was asked about its meaning [ṣidq] and said:It is that there no longer remains a share for a person"s lower self.Sahl said:No one will get a whiff of the fragrance of veracity as long as he panders to his lower self or to others. Rather, veracity is that a person feels in his innermost secret (sirr) that there is no one on the face of the earth from whom God has demanded servanthood besides him. Furthermore, his hope is his fear, and his fear is [of] his demise (intiqāl). Then when God, Exalted is He, sees them [the veracious] in this state, He takes upon himself the care of their affairs (tawallā umūrahum) and suffices for them (kafāhum), and every hair on their bodies speaks [as one] with God (maʿa"Llāh) in gnosis (maʿrifa). Thereafter God, Exalted is He, says to them on the Day of Judgement, "For whom did you work, and what did you desire?" They will reply, "We worked for You, and You alone did we desire." He will say to them, "You have spoken the truth." And by His Might, His words of testimony affirming their veracity are a greater source of joy to them than the bliss of Paradise.Aḥmad b. Mattā was asked about the meaning of his [Sahl"s] saying, that the hope of veracity is his fear, and that his fear is [of] his demise (intiqāl). He said:It is because veracity (ṣidq) is their hope and what they seek, but they fear that they are not veracious in their quest (ṭalab), so that God will not accept it from them. He has said regarding this: and [those] who give what they give while their hearts tremble [with awe] [23:60], meaning that they are in trepidation while doing acts of obedience, for fear that they will suffer rejection.His words:</text>

      <text>For Muslim men and women"He said:Faith (īmān) is superior to surrender (islām), but mindfulness of God (taqwā) within faith is superior to faith. Certainty (yaqīn) within mindfulness of God is superior to mindfulness of God, but veracity (ṣidq) within certainty is superior to certainty. Truly, you have taken a firm hold on the lowest (adnā) [of these], so you must not by any means let that escape from you.He also said:Faith in God is established (thābit) in the heart, and certainty is firmly rooted (rāsikh) [in it] through veracity (ṣidq). Veracity of the eye is refraining from looking at all that is forbidden. Veracity of the tongue is relinquishing engagement in that which is meaningless. Veracity of the hand is not extending it to seize what is forbidden. Veracity of the feet is refraining fromwalking in quest of indecent acts. The truth of veracity (ḥaqīqat al-ṣidq) in ⸢the heart⸣ is that it constantly reflects on the past and refrains from regarding what is to come. Verily, God, Exalted is He, has granted the veracious (ṣiddīqūn) so much knowledge that if they spoke of it, the ocean would dry up with their speech. They are hidden and do not appear in public before people, except when it is [absolutely] necessary for them, and until a virtuous [servant] (ṣāliḥ) appears, at which point they make themselves known, and teach the learned (ʿulamāʾ) from their different branches of knowledge.His words, Exalted is He:</text>
      <text>"and the men who remember God often and the women who remember God often"The one who observes true remembrance (al-dhākir ʿalā"l-ḥaqīqa) is he who is aware that God witnesses him. He perceives Him with his heart as being close to him, and therefore feels shame before Him. Then he gives Him priority over himself and over everything else in every situation.On another occasion Sahl was asked, "What is remembrance (dhikr)?" He said, "Obedience (ṭāʿa)." Then someone asked, "What is obedience?" He replied, "Sincerity (ikhlāṣ)." Then he was asked, "What is sincerity?" and he answered, "Witnessing (mushāhada)." Someone then asked, "What is witnessing?"He replied, "Servanthood (ʿubūdiyya)." Then they asked: "What is servanthood?" He answered, "Contentment (riḍā)." Then they asked, "What is contentment?" He replied, "Neediness (iftiqār)." He was asked: "What is neediness?" and he said, "It is humble entreaty (taḍarruʿ) and seeking refuge [in Him] (iltijāʾ). Submit! Submit, until death!"Ibn Sālim said:Remembrance is of three kinds: remembrance of the tongue, and that is a good deed (ḥasana) which is rewarded tenfold; remembrance of the heart, and that is a good deed which is rewarded seven-hundred fold; and a form of remembrance whose reward is beyond being weighed, and that is being filled with love [of God] (maḥabba).His words:</text>

The other kind of provision is that which is eaten, drunk and so on for the benefit of one"s [physical] nature (ṭabʿ). It is this kind which falls under what is permitted (ḥalāl) or prohibited (ḥarām). The legitimate is that which God, Exalted is He, has provided for us, and commanded us to partake of.

      <text>O mankind! It is you who stand in need of God"He said:That is, "You [depend] upon Him in your very selves, for truly when God created all creatures He imposed upon His servants neediness (faqr) for Him, while He is the Rich and Independent (al-Ghanī). Furthermore, whoever claims to be wealthy has been veiled from God, Mighty and Majestic is He. On the other hand, whoever shows his need for God, will find that He joins his need to His wealth. The servant should feel the need for Him in his innermost secret (sirr), cutting himself off from all other than Him, so that his servanthood (ʿubūdiyya) becomes pure (maḥḍa); for pure servanthood is self-abasement (dhull) and humble submission (khuḍūʿ).He was asked, "How does one show one"s need for Him?" He said:The neediness takes three [forms]: [the servants"] showing [awareness] of having been needy from pre-eternity (faqruhum al-qadīm); their showing need in their state (faqr ḥālihim), and their showing neediness through the death of the self to its [own] devising and managing [of things] (tadbīr). Whoever does not come up to [these standards] is false in his claim to neediness.He also said:The truly needful [person] (al-faqīr al-ṣādiq) is the one who does not ask [for things except from God] (lā yasʾalu), does not turn down [that which has been granted to him by God] (lā yaruddu), and does not hold back [from giving in the path of God when asked] (lā yaḥbisu).ʿUmar b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz said that the friends of God can be described [as having] three characteristics[lit. things]: confidence (thiqa) in God, Exalted is He, in everything; showing neediness for Him (faqr ilayhi) in everything; and taking refuge in Him (rujūʿ ilayhi) from everything.His words:</text>

Wāṣil stated that he heard heard Sahl say:The one who is foremost (sābiq) is the one who is learned; one who is in the middle position (muqtaṣid) is the one who is learning (mutaʿallim), and the one who has wronged himself (ẓālim) is the one who is ignorant (jāhil).He also said:The one who is foremost is he who is only preoccupied with his Hereafter; the one who is in the middle position is the one who is preoccupied with his Hereafter and his life in this world; but the wrongdoer is he who is preoccupied only with his worldly life, without any concern for his Hereafter. Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (may God have mercy on him) said the foremost are those whose good deeds outweigh their misdeeds, those who are in the middle position are the ones whose good deeds and misdeeds balance each other, while the wrongdoers are those whose misdeeds outweigh their good deeds.His words:</text>

      <text>You can only warn him who follows the Remembrance, and fears the Compassionate One in secret"He said:The one who worships God in his innermost secret (sirr), will be endowed with certainty (yaqīn) by God. The one who worships God with a truthful tongue, will find his heart ascends to the very Throne. The one who worships God with equity (inṣāf), will have the heavens and the earth weigh [in his favour]. He was asked, "What is equity (inṣāf) [in worship]?" He replied:It is that none of your bodily members moves unless it be for God. Furthermore, when you ask Him for the next day"s provision (rizq), your equity has left you, for the heart cannot bear two concerns (hammān). Equity between you and other people is when you take from them with the attitude that you are receiving a favour. However, if you demand to be treated justly, that means you are not being equitable. It was related of John the Baptist and Jesus that they went out walking, and John bumped into a woman, upon which Jesus said to him, "O son of my maternal aunt! Today you have committed a grave sin for which I do not think God will forgive you." He responded, "And what is that?" He said, "You bumped into a woman." He said, "By God, I did not notice her." Jesus said "Glory be to God! Your body is with me but where is your heart?" He said, "It is attached to the Throne, and if my heart were to find rest with the angel Gabriel for just a blinking of the eye, I would consider myself as not having known God, Mighty and Majestic is He."His words:</text>

No one"s actions become truly sincere, nor his worship whole, as long as he tries to evade four things: hunger (jūʿ), nakedness (ʿury), poverty (faqr) and abasement (dhilla). Indeed, God, Exalted is He, made his servants worship Him through the following three: the intellect (ʿaql), the spirit (rūḥ) and [physical] strength (quwwa). If he is afraid of [losing] two of these, the loss of intellect and theloss of the spirit, then he should take pains to perform well [the acts of worship]. As for [the loss of] physical strength, then there is no taking pains to perform them or learn them well, even if he prays seated. His words, Exalted is He:</text>

He said:We have heard that the following is written in the Psalms, "I did not decree anything for a believer which he either liked or detested without its being good for him." And it is related that God, Exalted is He, revealed the following to Abraham, "There is no one [whose provision in this world] I have increased, but that I have decreased by the same proportion [his provision] in the Hereafter, and that goes for you also, My true friend." Abū Yaʿqūb al-Sūsī relates, "A faqīr came to us while we were in Arrajān and Sahl b. ʿAbd Allāh happenedto be there also on that day. He [the faqīr] said, "You are the people of [God"s] special care (ahl al-ʿināya). Indeed, a severe trial and affliction (miḥna) has descended upon me." Sahl said to him, "In the registry of afflictions, it descended only after you exposed yourself to this matter. So what is it?" He replied, "Something of this world opened itself up to me, so I took possession of it to the exclusion of my family and thus lost my faith and my [spiritual] state (ḥāl)." Sahl said, "What do you say concerning this, O Abū Yaʿqūb?" I replied, "The affliction was more intense [for him] regarding [the loss of] his state than regarding [the loss of] his faith." Sahl responded, "A person like you would say that O Abū Yaʿqūb."" Sahl was asked about the [spiritual] state (ḥāl). He replied:The state of remembrance (dhikr) [at the level of] knowledge (ʿilm) is tranquil repose [in God] (sukūn), and the state of remembrance [at the level of] the intellect (ʿaql) is profound peace (ṭumaʾnīna). The state of mindfulness of God (taqwā) [at the level of] Islam [consists of observing]the limits [of the law] (ḥudūd), and the state of mindfulness of God [at the level of] faith (īmān) is profound peace (ṭumaʾnīna). If the servant has a state, and an affliction visits him, and he then asks for relief through a state lower than the one he is in, that counts as a defilement (ḥadath) from him.He was asked, "Why is that?", and he said, "It is like someone who is hungry asking for satiation, because the rank of the hungry is higher."

      <text>God takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that have not died, in their sleep"He said:When God takes the souls (anfus) to Himself, He extracts the luminous spirit (rūḥ nūrī) from the subtle substance (laṭīf) of the dense natural self (nafs al-ṭabʿ al-kathīf). The taking up [of souls] (al-tawaffī) in God"s Book is of three kinds: the first is death (mawt), the second, sleep (nawm), and the third, ascension (rafʿ). Death is as we have just mentioned. Sleep is as [described] in His words: and those that have not died, in their sleep, which means that He also takes unto Himself (yatawaffā) those who have not died, in their sleep (manām). [God also] said, It is He who takes you at night [6:60] meaning, in sleep. Ascension (rafʿ) is mentioned in relation to Jesus, to whom God said, "O Jesus, I am gathering you and raising you to Me" [3:55]. Thus when a person dies, He [God] removes (yanziʿu) from him the subtle substance (laṭīf) of the luminous spiritual self (nafs al-rūḥ al-nūrī) [separating it] from the subtle substance (laṭīf) of the dense natural self (nafs al-ṭabʿ al-kathīf), and by this [luminous spiritual self] he comprehends things (yaʿqilu al-ashyāʾ), and is given the vision (rūʾyā) in the heavenly kingdom (malakūt). However, when a person sleeps, He extracts from him the subtle substance of the dense natural self, not the subtle substance of the luminous spiritual self. Therefore, when the sleeping person awakens, he recovers a subtle breath (nafas laṭīf) from the subtle substance of the spiritual self, for if this were to part from him, it would leave him without motion (ḥaraka), and lifeless (mayyit). Thus, the dense natural self has a subtle substance (laṭīfa) and likewise the spiritual self has a subtle substance (laṭīfa). The life of the subtle substance of the natural self is by virtue of the light of the subtle substance of the spiritual self (nūr laṭīf nafs al-rūḥ). The spiritual life of the subtle substance of the spiritual self (ḥayāt rūḥ laṭīf nafs al-rūḥ) is by virtue of remembrance [of God] (dhikr), just as He has said: rather they are living with their Lord, provided for [by Him] [3:169], that is, they are sustained by remembrance, due to what they attained through the subtle luminous self.</text>

      <text>Say [that God declares]: "O My servants who have been prodigal against their souls!

It was related of the angel Gabriel that he heard Abraham pray, "O You who are Most Generous in pardoning!" Then Gabriel said to him, "O Abraham! Do you know what the generosity of His pardon (ʿafw) [implies]?" He answered, "No, O Gabriel." He continued, "It is that when He pardons a misdeed, He converts it into a good deed." Then Sahl said:Witness this of me: it is part of my religion that I do not disown the sinners among the nation of Muḥammad, nor the wicked, the murderers, the adulterers or the thieves, for truly, the extent of the generosity, bounty, and beneficence that God, Exalted is He, shows, especially to the nation of Muḥammad, cannot be fathomed.His words:</text>

      <text>And whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will enhance for him his harvest"He said:The harvest of the Hereafter is being satisfied [with one"s lot] (qanāʿa) in this world, and [finding]contentment (riḍā) in the Hereafter. The harvest of this world is that which is sought other than Him.He [also] said:Another shade of meaning is that he who acts for the sake of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, in a state of compliance (ījāban), without seeking a reward, [will find that] everything which is sought other than God, Mighty and Majestic is He, becomes diminished in his sight. Thus, he desires neither the world, nor Paradise, but desires only the vision (naẓar) of Him, this being the share (ḥaẓẓ) of the intuition of the spiritual self (dhihn nafs al-rūḥ), the understanding of the intellect (fahm al-ʿaql), and the discernment of the heart (fiṭnat al-qalb), as when He addressed them [before] (ka-mā khāṭabahum); for conformity [lit. imitation, iqtidāʾ], on that occasion was without the presence of the natural self (nafs ṭabīʿiyya). Notwithstanding the fact that the [natural] self receives a share [of the beatific vision in Paradise], like a fragrant breeze, due to its being fused with those lights. [However,] whoever acts for the sake of this world, "We will give him of it, but in the Hereafterhe will have no portion (naṣīb), for his ⸢natural⸣ self will be occupied with the enjoyment (tanaʿʿum or naʿīm) of Paradise, which itself is its share (ḥaẓẓ), [while forgoing] its portion in the Hereafter, namely the vision of God for eternity (ruʾyat al-Ḥaqq ʿalā"l-abad).

Consequently they went astray and misled [others].Then he said:Following (ittibāʿ) [is the key], following! Emulation (iqtidāʾ) [is the key], emulation!

He replied, "Do not fear! It"s only that the lion heard the speech of Shaybān al-Rāʿī so he started to wag his tail." Then Shaybān approached him and proceeded to take hold of his ear and twist it. Then I said, "O Shaybān what is this fame you have?" He answered, "And what sort of fame is it that you see, O Thawrī? I swear by God that if it wasn"t for the fear of fame I wouldn"t have carried my provisions for the journey to Mecca other than [loaded] on its back." Shaybān was on his way to the Friday prayer when he caught sight of a wolf with his sheep, so he said to it, "Sit with the sheep until I return and I will give you a lamb." When he returned from the Friday prayer, he found the wolf sitting down looking after the sheep, so he gave him a lamb to take away." Sahl used to say to a youth who kept his company, "If you are afraid of predatory beasts then do not keep my company." And he was asked, "How does a man reach the rank of charismatic gifts (karāmāt)? He replied:"Whoever abstains from (zahada) the world for forty days in veracity and sincerity (ṣādiqan wa mukhliṣan), will have charismatic gifts (karāmāt) manifested to Him from God, Mighty and Majestic is He.

      <text>It was He who sent down the spirit of peace (sakīna) into the hearts of the believers"That is, profound peace (ṭumaʾnīna). For God first of all discloses to His servants gnosis (maʿārif), then forms of mediation (wasāʾil), then the spirit of peace (sakīna), and lastly intuitive insights (baṣāʾir). And one to whom God discloses intuitive insights, knows things according to their essences (jawāhir), as did Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq who never erred in speech.His words:</text>
      <text>And to God belong the forces of the heavens and the earth"He said:His forces (junūd) are of different kinds: His forces in heaven are the prophets (anbiyāʾ), and on earth, [His] friends (awliyāʾ). His forces in heaven are hearts (qulūb), and on the earth, souls (nufūs). Whatever God empowers (sallaṭa) over you, [may be counted as being] among His forces. If He empowers your lower self over you, your lower self will itself destroy you; and likewise, if He empowers your bodily members over you, they themselves will destroy you. If your lower self overpowers your heart, it will drive you to the pursuit of desire (hawā). But if your heart overpowers your lower self and your bodily members, it will tether them with propriety (adab), compel them into worship (ʿibāda), and then adorn them with sincerity in servanthood (ikhlāṣ fi"l-ʿubūdiyya). All of these together amount to God"s forces.His words:</text>

He observes his increase (ziyāda) [in a good state, distinguishing it] from his decline (nuqṣān), and shows gratitude on seeing an increase, but when there is a decline, devotes himself [to remedying it] and makes supplication.It is through these [real believers] that God repels calamity (balāʾ) from the inhabitants of earth. The [true] believer is never lax (mutahāwin) with the slightest shortcoming, for laxity with a little will inevitably lead to [laxity in] a lot.He further said:The servant will not get the taste of faith until he abandons six vices [lit. character traits, khiṣāl]: he should abandon what is forbidden (ḥarām), illegal possessions (suḥut), what is dubious (shubha), ignorance (jahl), intoxicant[s] (muskir) and ostentation (riyāʾ); [on the other hand] he should adhere to [six virtues]: knowledge (ʿilm), putting his actions right (taṣḥīḥ al-ʿamal), integrity of heart (naṣḥ bi"l-qalb), veracity of the tongue (ṣidq bi"l-lisān), correct conduct (ṣalāḥ) in associating with people and sincerity (ikhlāṣ) in the way he deals with his Lord.He also said:The Book of God is founded upon five [virtues]: veracity (ṣidq), seeking the best [through God"s guidance] (istikhāra), consultation (istishāra), patience (ṣabr) and gratitude (shukr).His words:</text>

Indeed the Prophet said: "The most untruthful of reports is that of opinion (ẓann)." Then Sahl said:Bad opinion comes from ignorance and pertains to the natural self (nafs al-ṭabʿ). The most ignorant person is the one who estranges his heart [from God] without being aware of it. Indeed, God, Exalted is He, has said: And that suspicion of yours which you held about your Lord has ruined you, so you have become among the losers. [41:23] Certainly, the servant is deprived of blessed provision and prayer at night because of bad opinion.One night a man, one of [God"s] servants, slept through [and missed] his customary rite (wird) and felt regret over it. [He] was asked: "Do you feel regret about [missing] that which you are wont to perform?" He replied, "I do not feel regret because of that, but rather because of the sin through which I became deprived of that good [deed]."Sahl was asked, "What is the meaning of the Prophet"s words : "Be on your guard with people, [by holding a] bad opinion (sūʾ al-ẓann).""

Then when God, Exalted is He, sent His angels to Him, he rejoiced at them and served them himself, but did not eat with them. This is the mark of true friendship (khilla), that is, to feed others without eating oneself, and to cure another"s illness when one is sick. His words, Exalted is He:</text>

Each day seventy thousand angels make a pilgrimage to it, and never return" " to the end of the ḥadīth.

It is to this [the mystic"s heart] that the angels make pilgrimage, for it is the House of the Realisation of God"s Oneness (bayt al-tawḥīd).His words, Exalted is He:</text>

The one who conforms reveres him and his standing (shaʾn), and the one who opposes holds him in awe and fears him. This is the light which God made for His friends and it does not appear in anyone unless he has submitted and humbled himself to Him. It belongs to the light of faith.

Then on the last day of his life a man recited the verse before him, So on this day no ransom will be taken from you, and I saw him tremble and sway to the point where he almost fell down. When he recovered his state of sobriety (ṣaḥw), I asked him about what had passed, saying, "Nothing has happened like this during my time with you." Hereplied, "Yes I know, my dear friend! Indeed I have become weak." So I asked, "What is the condition [that denotes] a strong state (quwwat al-ḥāl)?" He replied, "There is no influx [from above] (wārid) that comes over him without his absorbing it through his strength. Whoever acts in this way will not be changed by the influxes [of grace] (wāridāt) that he receives, howeverstrong they may be."He also used to say, "My state during [ritual] prayer (ṣalāt) is the same as that before the commencementof the prayer." This is because he would keep watch over his heart and keep God, Exalted is He, before his eyes with his innermost secret (sirr) before commencing the prayer, and consequently he would stand for prayer with the presence of his heart (ḥuḍūr qalbihi) and the collectedness of his spiritual energy (jamʿ himmatihi).

      <text>Know that the life of this world is merely play and diversion"He said:The world (dunyā) is a sleeping soul (nafs nāʾima), and the Hereafter is a soul awake (nafs yaqẓāna).It was asked, "What is the way to salvation from it [the life of this world]?" He replied:The root of this [salvation] is knowledge (ʿilm) and its fruit is opposing one"s desire (hawā) by avoiding what is forbidden (manāhī). Then it is the soul"s endurance (mukābadat al-nafs) in fulfilling the divine commandments, [in a state of] purity (ṭahāra) from every kind of defilement(adnās). This will bring about ease in worship, and thereafter he will abide in the stations of the worshippers. Then God will let him experience that which His friends (awliyāʾ) and elect (aṣfiyāʾ) experienced, which is the rank of tasting (madhāq). He [Abū Bakr al-Sijzī] said, "He [Sahl] then mentioned to us the following":One day Abraham, Friend of the Lord of Mercy, was in the desert on an extremely hot day, and he was afflicted with great thirst. He saw an Abyssinian man tending some camels, so he asked: "Do you have any water?" He replied, "O Abraham, what do you prefer: water or milk?" He said: "Water."He [Sahl] continued:He then struck a rock with his foot upon which water gushed forth. Abraham was amazed, so God said to Abraham, through inspiration, "If that Abyssinian man had asked Me to remove the heavens and earth from existence I would have removed them." So he [Abraham] asked, "Why is that, O Lord?" He replied, "It is because he does not desire anything from the world or the Hereafter except Me." ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays said,I have found the world to comprise four main properties (khiṣāl). As for two of these, namely, the [desire for] women and the [desire] to amass wealth, my soul (nafs) has renounced them willingly. However, as for the other two, there is no doing without them, though I try to keep them away from me as much as I can; these are sleep and food. His words, Exalted is He:</text>

Indeed, God, Exalted is He, is not [even] pleased ⸢when one who is His friend⸣ depends upon [another who is] His friend, so how will it be when he depends on [one who is] His enemy? Furthermore, a person who engages his heart in that which does not concern him relating to his Hereafter gains an enemy, so how will it be concerning some other [affair that does not concern him]?And a person who covets (ṭamaʿa) the Hereafter along with a desire for something lawful (ḥalāl) of this world is deluded (makhdūʿ), so how will it be for someone who desires something unlawful (ḥarām)?Anyone"s act that is not done in opposition (mukhālafa), or with endurance (mukābada), or out of preferring others over oneself (īthār), will be an act of ostentation (riyāʾ).He was asked the meaning of this. He replied:Opposition is the abandonment of what is forbidden, and for sure, abandoning a particle of what God has forbidden is more meritorious than worshipping God, Exalted is He, for your whole life. To show endurance is to fulfil God"s commandments, while to prefer others over oneself is to prefer God above all that is other than Him.Furthermore, through opposition they were dispossessed of their selves, but through endurancethey were dispossessed of their desires, so that their passions (shahawāt) were expressed through acts of obedience (ṭāʿāt); and by giving preference to others over themselves (īthār), they attained His love and good pleasure.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

Such claims require of [the servant] that from this day on he fulfil one of the rights of God, which is that he becomes free of (barāʾa), and repents from (tawba), every sin that he has committed.[The one who makes claims] says "I will act tomorrow", but there is no one who makes a claim without overlooking the right of God from two points of view: both outwardly and inwardly. The one who makes claims (muddaʿī) has no fear; the one who has no fear is not safe (āmin); and the one who is not safe is one who has not acquainted himself with the recompense (jazāʾ).He also said:Those who desire the Hereafter are many. However, there are but two [kinds of] servant whose sufficiency (kifāya) God takes care of: [one is] the simple servant who is nonetheless sincere in his quest, puts his trust in God (mutawakkil), and is true to Him; his Master will suffice him and take care of all of his affairs. The other is the servant who is knowledgeable about God, His days, His commandments and His prohibitions; God will suffice him with all he needs in this world and, when he passes on to the Hereafter, ⸢he will have ease (istirāḥa)⸣.

      <text>"And whoever puts his trust in God, He will suffice him"He said:That is, whoever entrusts his affairs to his Lord, will truly find that God, Exalted is He, suffices him in all that is necessary for him in both abodes. Abū al Ḥasan ʿUmar b. Wāṣil al-ʿAnbarī reported that he heard Sahl say:I entered the desert seventeen times without any provision (zād) in the way of food and drink, or a money bag, or a drinking vessel or a staff, and whenever I needed something to eat, I would find it ready prepared for me. On one occasion as I was approaching the desert, a man gave me two genuine dirhams, so I put them in my pocket and proceeded on my way. I had walked for a while but did not find anything so I became weak. I started to say to myself, "What have you done that has resulted in that which you are accustomed to being withheld from you?" Then I heard a voice from the air (min al-hawā) say, "Cast out what is in your pocket and what is in the unseen will come to you", upon which I remembered that I had those two dirhams in my pocket, so I took them out and threw them away. I had not walked for long before I saw before me two pieces of bread spread with honey between them, [as fresh] as if they had just that moment come out of the oven. So from then on I returned to my former state [of tawakkul].His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>O you who believe! Turn to God in sincere repentance"He said:Sincere repentance (tawba naṣūḥ) means that a person does not return [to sin], for he has become one of the company of lovers (aḥibba), and the lover does not embark upon anything which the Beloved dislikes.And he said:The mark of the one who is [truly] repentant (tāʾib) is that there is not a place on earth, nor a place under the sky, where he is not solely attached to the Throne and to the Owner of the Throne till the time when he leaves this world. In these times, I do not know of anyone not requiring repentance, for the Angel of Death will not visit any one of us without his saying [to the angel], "Just allow me to do such-and-such a thing. Just let me do so-and-so. Let me breathe for just an hour more." Then he said:As for the one who is sincerely repentant (tāʾib mukhliṣ), even though it might be for only an hour, or even for one breath before his death, it will be said [to him], "How quickly you have come forth with true [sincere repentance] (ṣaḥīḥan)! [Accordingly] we have come to you in the manner that you have come."His words:</text>
      <text>"on a day when God will not let the Prophet down"He said:He will not let him down concerning his nation, and will not refuse his intercession. Indeed God, Exalted is He, addressed the Prophet through inspiration saying, "If you so wish I can place the affairs of your nation (amr ummatik) in your charge." He replied, "O my Lord, You are better for them than me." So God, Exalted is He, said, "Then I will not let you down concerning them." His words, Mighty and Majestic is He:</text>
      <text>"They will say, "Our Lord! Perfect our light for us""He said:The state of utter neediness (iftiqār) does not leave the believers, either in this life or the next. When they are in Paradise they are in greater need for Him even though they are in the abode of honour, security and richness, because of their yearning for the encounter (liqāʾ) with Him. They say: "Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and grant us an encounter with You." This is because He is the Illuminator of [all] lights (munawwir al-anwār), and He is the Goal of every seeker.His words, Exalted is He:</text>

Whatever it passes by and [merely] catches a whiff of it, lives. It has been related in a tradition that the people of Paradise will fear death but the people of Hell will wish for death.

However, when he gives up relying on his own strength, weakness will take68 Al-Qalam (or Nūn)243up residence in his soul, and this will generate mercy (raḥma) and benevolence (luṭf) from him, which is to take on the characteristics of the Lord, may His majesty be magnified.God, Exalted is He, addressed David through inspiration, saying, "Take on My characteristics,for verily I am the Forbearing (al-Ṣabūr)." Whoever is given good character (khulq ḥasan) has been given the greatest station (aʿẓam al-maqāmāt), for all other stations are connected to the common folk (ʿāmma), whereas good character is connected with the [divine] attributes (ṣifāt) and qualities (nuʿūt). Sahl was asked one day about charismatic gifts (karāmāt) and he said:What are charismatic gifts (karāmāt)? Truly charismatic gifts are phenomena which will not last beyond their designated time.

It is also related that ʿUmar once said to Kaʿb, "Frighten us, O Abū Isḥāq". So he said, "O Commanderof the believers, if you performed acts of worship to the extent that you became like a pruned stick, and you had to your credit the works of seventy prophets, you would still think that you will not be saved from the command of your Lord and the Throne Bearers. When the Preserved Tablet is brought forward with the record of all the deeds, when Hell is displayed and Paradise is brought near, and humanity stands before the Lord of the Worlds, Hell will heave a sigh that will cause every one of the angels who are drawn near (malak muqarrab) and every prophet messenger (nabī mursal) to fall down on their knees without exception, to the point that Abraham will cry "My soul! My soul!" Then the just man (rajul ʿādil) and the oppressor (rajul jāʾir) will be summoned, [the name of each being called out] above the heads of the masses. When the just man is brought forward, his book will be raised up to him for him to receive in his right hand. There is no happiness, no joy, and no rapture that ever descended on a servant greater than that which will descend on him on that day. And he will say above the heads of the crowds what God, Exalted is He, related. Then the oppressor will be brought forward andhis book will be thrust into his left hand, and there is no grief, no humiliation, and no distress that ever befell a man severer than that which will befall that man. He will then say above the heads of the crowds what God, Exalted is He, has related. Then he will be seized and dragged on his face to the Fire and his flesh, bones and brains will be scattered about."Upon this ʿUmar cried, "That"s enough for me! Enough!"

Then he said:The scholars sought [the justification] for having scruples (waswasa), concerning the Book and the Sunna, but they could not find a basis for it except legitimate inquisitiveness (fuḍūl al-ḥalāl), and legitimate inquisitiveness is that the servant considers a time other than the time he is in. This, [however] is [on the basis of] hope (amal). It is related from Ḥubaysh on the authority of Ibn ʿAbbās y that the Prophet would pass water and then wipe himself with earth. So he [Ibn ʿAbbās?] said, "O Messenger of God, there is water near you!", to which he replied, "I do not know, it may be that I won"t reach it." And [the Prophet said to Usāma (b. Zayd)], "Our nearness to [obtaining water] is two months away. Indeed, Usāma has far-reaching hopes (ṭawīl al-amal)!"Sahl was asked, "How does the world leave the heart?" He replied:By the shortening of hope.[Then] he was asked: "What is it that shortens hope?" He replied:It is cutting off from concerns (humūm) with what is guaranteed (maḍmūn), and finding reliance(sukūn) on the Guarantor (al-Ḍāmin).His words, Exalted is He:</text>

They do not repose in anything other than Him and they do not fear anything other than Him, their [only source of] anxiety being the possibility of separation from Him, just as He says, and who are apprehensive of the chastisement of their Lord [70:27].The saying is narrated from the Prophet : "According to what the highest host in the highest ranks informed me, among the best of my nation are people who laugh out loud at the amplitude of the mercy of their Lord, and weep in secret out of fear of the severity of the punishment of their Lord. They remember their Lord morning and night in His blessed houses, and make supplications to Him with their tongues in hope and fear. They petition Him with their hands, lowering [their upturned palms] and raising them, and they long for Him constantly with their hearts.

The word nafar refers to a number between three and ten. They came to the Prophet while he was reciting Qurʾān in his prayer. They were among the best of their people in religion, and when they heard it, they were moved by it (raqqū lahu) and they believed in it. Then they returned to their people as warners, and said, "We have indeed heard a marvellous Qurʾān,! which guides to rectitude" [72:1, 2], meaning, "It guides [people] to follow the ways of Muṣṭafā ".Sahl said:Once I saw in the place that was home to the ʿĀd people of old, a city built of stone, within which there was a magnificent palace that that had been carved out of the rock, which was a refuge for the jinn. I entered the palace to reflect [upon it], and I saw a large person standingin prayer facing the Kaʿba, wearing a long white woollen garment (jubba) which had a certain freshness (ṭarāwa) about it. I was impressed with its freshness, so I waited until he had finished his prayer and then I said: "Peace be upon you." He replied: "And upon you be peace, Abū Muḥammad. Were you impressed with the freshness of my garment which has been on me for nine hundred years, and in which I met with Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon them both) and Muḥammad, and believed in them both?

And this is a maxim for sincerity (ikhlāṣ) in the profession of God"s oneness(tawḥīd), since the truth (ḥaqīqa) of professing His oneness means looking towards God and none other, advancing towards Him (iqbāl ʿalayhi) and relying upon Him (iʿtimād ʿalayhi).

What has deceived you with regard to your Generous Lord?He said:That is, "What has lured you away to other than Him, and severed you from Him, in spite of His graciousness (luṭf) and generosity (karam)?"He was asked, "What is it that cuts the servant off [from God]?" He replied:The servant belongs to God, and God is there for His servant. There is nothing closer to Him than the heart of the believer, and if anything else comes into his heart, that becomes a veil (ḥijāb) [for him]. Whoever looks upon (naẓara) God with his heart, will become distanced from all besides Him, and whoever seeks the means to [attain] His good pleasure (marḍā), will be made satisfied by God through His clemency (ḥilm).Furthermore, whoever surrenders his heart to God, Exalted is He, [will find that] God takes care of his bodily members so they remain in rectitude (istiqāma). Yet at the same time, their hearts" witnessing is in proportion to how much they safeguard their bodily members.Then he said:Keep a check on your hearts. We are created and our Creator is with us. Do not tire in your works, for truly God watches over you wherever you are. Place your needs before Him and stand at His door. Say: "We are ignorant, but our Teacher (ʿālimunā) is with us. We are weak, but the One who gives us strength (muqawwiyyunā) is with us. We are helpless, but our All-Powerful One (Qādirunā) is with us."

      <text>Woe to the defrauders!He said:They are the hypocrites and those who take on their characteristics, stinting in their prayer. Thus did Salmān [al-Fārisī] say, "The prayer is the balance (mikyāl); whoever deals faithfully will be rewarded his due, but as for whoever stints " you already know what God, Exalted is He, has said concerning the defrauders (muṭaffifūn): Will you bid others to piety and forget yourselves...? [2:44]. You vilify them for the slips they make that are typical of the faults of men, and yet you commit similar misdeeds and those which are more abominable still." No one looks upon the slips of [other] people except an ignorant wrongdoer, and no one [may] make known that which he has looked upon [of the faults of others] except God. Indeed it has been related that God spoke to David through inspiration the words, "I complain of My servants to you, O David!" He asked, "And why is that, my Lord?" He replied, "It is because they sin in secret and repent in public, and truly I do not wish anyone to look upon the sin of my servant besides Me."ʿUmar b. Wāṣil said that he had asked Sahl about God"s words, Nay, on that day they will be veiled from their Lord [83:15]. He replied:In this life they are veiled from the Commander (al-Āmir) and the Restrainer (al-Zājir). Thus it was related in a report, "Happy is the one whose heart acts for him as an admonisher and whose intellect as a restrainer." So if a person wants something from which God is absent, they [the heart and intellect] will hold him back from it. " [But as for those mentioned in the verse], in the Hereafter they are veiled from the [divine] mercy, and from being able to behold God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and are deprived of His looking upon them with His good pleasure (riḍā) and satisfaction (riḍwān) when He questions them. Just as He has said, But [first] stop them, for they must be questioned [37:24] about [their] religion (diyāna), and they will not be able to shake off the evidence against them, so He will put them into the Hellfire.</text>

      <text>So truly with hardship comes ease,He said:God, Exalted is He, has magnified the state of hope (rajāʾ) in this verse out of His generosity (karam) and His hidden grace (khafī luṭfihi), and thus He mentions ease twice. Indeed, the Prophet said, "Hardship (ʿuṣr) will not overwhelm the two eases." By this he meant: the discernment of the heart (fiṭnat al-qalb) and the intellect (ʿaql) are the two "eases" which take control of the natural self, and return it to the state of sincerity (ikhlāṣ). This is [also]the inner meaning of the verse, namely that along with the hardship (shidda) of the natural self (nafsal-ṭabʿ), in its need for God Himself (dhāt al-Ḥaqq), Mighty and Majestic is He, [and] for the spiritual self (nafs al-rūḥ), ⸢[there comes] the ease (suhūla) of the spiritual self⸣, the intellect (ʿaql) and the discernment of the heart (fiṭnat al-qalb), and this, in its inner meaning, [signifies]the confident abandonment (taskīn) of the heart of Muḥammad to the [divine] succour (iʿāna) in fear. So He [God] said, "Truly, We gave ascendancy (sallaṭnā) over your dense natural self, to the subtle [substances] (laṭāʾif) of your spiritual self, intellect, heart and understanding(fahm), all of which pre-existed as a momentous gift (mawhiba jalīla) before the creation appeared by a thousand years, and thus did they subdue the natural self."</text>

      <text>So when you are finished, toil,"[When you have completed] the prescribed prayer (ṣalāt), and you are seated, toil towards your Lord, and return to Him as you were before [the existence] of the natural self, before the appearance of the creation, alone with the One alone, a secret with a secret." Hence, God granted him [Muḥammad] the likeness of his primordial rank in the world, just as the Prophet said, "Truly, I possess a moment (waqt) with God, during which I cannot attend to other than Him." This is the inner meaning of the verse. Its outer meaning is what is obvious.Abū ʿAmr b. ʿAlāʾ related the [following story], saying, "We fled from al-Ḥajjāj to the desert, and lived there for a period of time going from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. One morning I was wandering through some neighbourhoods with a distracted mind, clouded heart and feeling downcast, when suddenly I heard an Arab shaykh [who was] passing by recite the followingverses: [khafīf metre]Impose patience upon your soul and every worry will vanish. For in patience there is a device [to undo every] deceitMaybe the self detests something in which lies relief,Like the releasing of the cords binding a camel."The shaykh had not even completed the two couplets before I saw a knight calling out from afar, "Al-Ḥajjāj is dead!"" He [Abū ʿAmr] continued, "Then I asked the shaykh about the word "relief" (farja). He replied, "Furja with a ḍamm on the letter fāʾ is an opening in a wall or in the ʿūd or something similar, whereas farja with a fatḥa on the letter fāʾ is relief after hardship and misfortunes."" Abū ʿAmr then said, "I did not know which I was happier about, the death of al-Ḥajjāj or the lesson from which I had benefitted."His words, Exalted is He:</text>

Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī] said, "Short-sighted is the person who has had the world kept from him, yet does not realise that this is [a manifestation] of God"s regard for him. Moreover, short-sighted indeed is also the person who has had the world placed at his disposal, and does not fear that this may be a form of ruse (makr) that God is devising against him."

He was asked, "And what is sincerity (ikhlāṣ)?" He replied:It is responding (ijāba), and whoever does not respond has no sincerity. He also said:Sincerity has three facets: worshipping purely for God (ikhlāṣ al-ʿibāda li"Llāh), acting purely (ikhlāṣ al-ʿamal lahu) for Him, and [keeping one"s] heart purely for Him (ikhlāṣ al-qalb lahu).

      <text>Whoever has done an atom"s weight of good will see it,He said:When this verse was sent down, the Messenger of God gave a sermon in which he said, "Nay indeed, this world has an array of goods that are ready to hand which are consumed by the righteous (barr) and the wicked (fājir) alike. Nay indeed, the Hereafter is truly an appointed hour in which the All-powerful King will make the decree. Nay indeed, all of goodness in its entirety is in Paradise. Nay indeed, all of evil, in its entirety is in the Hellfire. So be aware, since you have already been cautioned by God, and know that you will be shown your deeds, Whoever has done an atom"s weight of good will see it,! but whoever has done an atom"s weight of evil will see that. [99:7, 8]" Abū al-Dardāʾ said, "Perfection in the mindfulness of God (taqwā) is that the servant fears God to the point that he fears Him even concerning a mere atom"s weight, such that he leaves aside some of the things he considers to be legitimate, for fear of the possibility of its being forbidden. This will act as a screen between him and [doing] what is forbidden." Sahl said:Do not consider any sin to be insignificant, even if it be small, for truly it has been said by some, "There are four things which come after a sin which are more serious that the sin itself: persistence [in sin], rejoicing [at it] (istibshār), deeming it insignificant (istiṣghār) and taking pride in it (iftikhār)."Ibn Masʿūd said, "The believer sees his sins as if he were at the foot of a mountain that he fears will fall on top on him, whereas the disbeliever sees sin as a fly which alights on his nose. Then he says, "It"s like this", with a gesture of his hand [as if it will] fly off."Then Sahl said:O assembly of Muslims! Indeed you have succeeded in professing on your tongue and believing with certainty in your heart that God is One, that there is none like Him, and that there is a Day for you on which He will resurrect you and on which He will question you about the [deedsyou did which were of an] atom"s weight.</text>

Do you not notice how firstly He confirmed that they were among those who pray, then He threatened them with a warning.

Theassociation concerning [God] Himself is unforgivable. But as for the association in a person"s dealing[s], ⸢this is subject to a stern threat (waʿīd shadīd), and it is subject to the divine will (mashīʾat Allāh).He was asked about the meaning of "association regarding his dealings", and he replied:⸣ It is as in the case of someone [who] makes the pilgrimage and prayers in the knowledge that other people will praise him for it. This is hidden association. In a tradition it is related, "Devote your works solely to God, for God accepts only what is sincere in a deed. And do not say, "This is for God" [for example] when you tie the bonds of kinship (raḥm); that is for kinship, there is nothing in it for God. ⸢Neither will it expiate [for you] any misdeed (maẓlama).⸣" Indeed, when Muʿādh requested of the Prophet, "Counsel me, O Messenger of God."

      <text>We have assuredly given you Abundance [al-Kawthar].He said:When al-Qāsim died in Mecca and Ibrāhīm in Medina, the Quraysh said that Muḥammad had become heirless. He was angered by this. Then the verse came down, We have assuredly given you Abundance, [that is], "We are consoling him and compensating him with Abundance (al-Kawthar)." "[Al-Kawthar] is a pool from which you can give whomever you wish a drink, with My permission, and refuse whomever you wish a drink from it, with My permission."</text>

      <text>and you see people entering God"s religion in throngs,and you see people, the people of Yemen, entering God"s religion in throngs, in multitudes (zumaran) " the tribe with its families, and the whole people. So, help your spirit (rūḥ) against your lower self (nafs) by preparing for the Hereafter, for it [the spirit] comes from it. The lower self desires the world because it comes from that, but the spirit desires the Hereafter because it comes from that. Gain ascendancy over the lower self and open for it the door to the Hereafter by glorifying [God] (tasbīḥ) and seeking forgiveness for your nation. From then on, he [the Prophet would seek forgiveness and glorify God] a hundred times in the morning and a hundred times in the evening. Furthermore, he would strive in worship night and day to the point where his feet swelled up, his eyes became red, and his cheeks became pale. He would smile little and weep and ponder a lot.It has been narrated from Ibn ʿAbbās y that he said, "When this sūra was revealed, the Companionsof the Prophet were gladdened by it, but Abū Bakr wept profusely. So the Messenger of God asked him "What makes you weep?" He said, "The parting of your soul has been announced for you O Messenger of God." The Prophet said to him, "You have spoken the truth." Then he said: "O God, grant him understanding of the religion, and teach him [the science of] interpretation (taʾwīl)." This is also a teaching in religion and glorification for his nation. Indeed Rabīʿ b. Khaythum said, "Reduce your speech except in nine [areas]: [in saying],"Glory be to God!", "Praise be to God!", "There is no god except God", "God is Great", and in the recitation of the Qurʾān, commanding what is right, forbidding what is wrong, asking for goodness and seeking refuge from evil."</text>

[This curse] is the response to Abū Lahab"s saying to the Prophet "May you perish!" when he gathered them together and invited them to the profession of God"s oneness, and warned them of the punishment with His words, And warn the nearest of your kinsfolk [26:214].His words, Exalted is He:</text>

      <text>Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak,He said:Truly God, Exalted is He, commanded him [the Prophet] in these two sūras [113 and 114] to take refuge (iʿtiṣām) in Him, seek help (istiʿāna) from Him, and show [his] need (faqr) for Him.He was asked, "What is showing [one"s] need?" He replied:It is the [substitution of one] state by another (huwa"l-ḥāl bi"l-ḥāl), for the natural disposition (ṭabʿ) is dead [in and of itself] and its life is in displaying this. He also said:The best form of purification (ṭahāra) is that the servant purifies himself from [the illusion of] his own power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa). Every act or saying that is not accompanied by the words: "there is no power or strength save in God", will not have God"s support, Mighty and Majestic is He. Furthermore, every saying which is not accompanied by the proviso, will incur a punishment for [the person who said it], even if it was an act [or saying] of righteousness.And for every affliction (muṣība) which is received without being accompanied by the saying of "return" (istirjāʿ), the afflicted person will not be given steadfastness when facing it [affliction] on the Day of Resurrection.He said:According to Ibn ʿAbbās y, al-falaq means the morning (ṣubḥ) while according to al-Ḍaḥḥāk it refers to a valley in the Hellfire. [On the other hand], according to Wuhayb it refers to a chamber in Hell, and according to Ḥasan it refers to a well in Hell.It has also been said that He intended by it all people (jamīʿ al-khalq). Or it has been said that it refers to the rock from which water springs forth.</text>

      <text>from the evil of that which He has created,from man and jinn. This is because Labīd b. Aʿṣam al-Yahūdī cast into the well of Banū Bayāḍa a spell against the Prophet, who used to frequent it. [One day as] he headed towards [the well] the spell [cast against him] possessed him and the Prophet became affected by it, so God sent down the two sūras of seeking refuge (muʿawwidhatayn), and the Angel Gabriel informed him of the magic spell. Then he sent two men among the Companions to [the well] and theytook it [the knot] out of the well. They brought it to the Prophet, upon which he started to untie the knot reciting the verses the while, so that the Messenger was cured without delay after having completed the two sūras.After this occurrence, Labīd used to go to the Prophet but he did not see any trace of [his spell] on the face of the Prophet, neither did he mention to him [what he had done].</text>

It has also been said [that it means]: when night first encroaches on [lit. "penetrates," dakhala] the day, [that is], when night is just beginning, devils among the jinn are released and anyone who is afflicted in that hour will not recover.Sahl [also] said regarding and from the evil of darkness when it gathers:Its inner meaning refers to remembrance, when regard for the self enters it, thereby screening it from sincerity towards God in the remembrance [purely] of Him.</text>

      <text>From the evil of the slinking whisperer,Sahl was asked, "What is "a whispering" (waswasa)? He replied:Everything besides God, Exalted is He, is a whispering. Truly, when the heart of a person is with God, Exalted is He, it speaks from God, Exalted is He, but if it is with other than Him, it speaks from other than Him.Then he said:Whoever desires this world will not be saved from whispering. The position of whispering in relation to the servant is that of the evil-inciting self (nafs ammāra bi"l-sūʾ) when it mentions [a suggestion] to the natural disposition (ṭabʿ). The whispering of the Enemy (ʿaduww) within the breasts is as in His words, "who whispers in the breasts of people "! whether they be of jinn or mankind [114:5, 6], meaning within the breasts of jinn and men alike. The whispering of the lower self is within the heart, for God, Exalted is He, has said: "We know what his soul whispers to him. We are closer to him than his aorta." [50:16]Knowledge (maʿrifa) of the lower self (nafs) is more elusive [lit. hidden, akhfī] than knowledge of the Enemy (ʿaduww), while knowledge of the Enemy is more apparent (ajlā) than knowledge of the world. The way to capture the enemy is through knowing him, for when you know him you have captured him, but if you do not know that he is the enemy then he has captured you.The similitude of the servant, the Enemy and the world is that of the hunter, the bird and the grain. The hunter is Satan (Iblīs), the bird is the servant and the grain is this world. There is not a [single] gaze (naẓar) that is not coveted by Satan. If you have been fasting [continuously] and wish to stop fasting he will say to you, "What will the people say? You, who are known for fasting, have given up fasting." If you respond with, "What do I care about people?" he will say to you, "You have spoken rightly, so stop fasting for they will put the matter of the cessation of your fast down to good judgement and sincerity." Likewise, if you are known for seclusion and you leave your seclusion, he will say, "What will people say? You have left your seclusion." If yourespond by saying, "What do I care about people?" He will say, "You have spoken rightly, so give up your seclusion, for they will put the cessation of your seclusion down to good judgement and sincerity.</text>
