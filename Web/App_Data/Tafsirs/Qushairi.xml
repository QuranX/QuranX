      <text>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</text>
      <text>The bāÌ in bismillāh ['in the Name of God'] is a grammatical particle of implication. That is to say 'by means of God' (bi-llāh), new things become manifest and by means of Him created things exist. There is nothing from any newly created thing (ḥādith makhlūq) or sequence of events (ḥāṣil mansūq); or from any perceived thing (ʿayn) or trace of a thing (athar), etc.; or anything else from rocks or clay, grass or trees, any impression left on the ground (rasm) or standing remains (ṭalal), or any judgment (ḥukm) or causes (ʿilal), that has existence except by means of the Real. The Real is its sovereign. Its beginning is from the Real and its return is to the Real. Through Him the one who declares the unity [of God] finds and through Him the rejecter abandons faith. Through Him the one who acknowledges knows, and through Him the one who perpetrates lags behind.</text>
      <text>He said, 'In the Name of God' rather than 'In God'. According to some people, this is a way of seeking blessing through mentioning His name. According to others, it is because of the difference between this [wording] and oaths. According to scholars, it is because the name (ism) is the thing that is named (musammā). In the view of the people of mystical knowledge (ʿirfān), [the wording is such] in order to seek the purification of hearts from attachments and the liberation of the innermost selves from obstacles so that the word 'God' may enter into a clean heart and purified innermost self.</text>
      <text>Upon the mention of this verse, some people are reminded from the [letter] bāÌ of His beneficence (birr) with His friends, and from the [letter] sīn of His secret (sirr) with his chosen ones, and from the [letter] mīm of His grace (minna) to the people of His friendship (ahl al-walāya). They know that by His beneficence, they come to know His secret, and by His grace to them, they preserve His command, and by Him (glory be to Him Most High) they recognize His measure.</text>
      <text>Other people, upon hearing 'In the Name of God', are reminded by the [letter] bāÌ of the immunity (barāÌa) of God (swt) from every evil, and by the [letter] sīn of His soundness (salāma) from any defect, and by the [letter] mīm of His magnificence (majd) in the exaltedness of His description.</text>

      <text>Praise be to God;</text>
      <text>The real meaning of praise (ḥamd) is extolling the One Who is praiseworthy (maḥmūd) by mentioning His sublime attributes and beautiful acts. The [letter] lām here [from the particle al in al-ḥamdu li-llāh] indicates an all-comprehensive category, since all praiseworthy acts are God's (s), either by attribution (waṣf) or creation (khalq). Praise belongs to Him because of the manifestation of His sovereign power, and gratitude belongs to Him because of the abundance of His goodness. Praise belongs to God because of what He is due for His sublimity and His beauty, and gratitude belongs to God because of the plentitude of His favors and the preciousness of His gifts. The praise for Him (s) which is from Him is from the attributes of His perfection and power, and the praise of Him which is from His creation is by virtue of His favors and His might. His sublimity and His beauty are His due because of the attributes of grandeur. They are His entitlement because of the qualities of exaltedness and loftiness. Eternal existence belongs to Him. Noble generosity belongs to Him. Unique permanence belongs to Him, as do everlasting being, eternal remaining, endless splendor, and perpetual praise. Hearing and seeing belong to Him, as do fate and divine decree, word and speech, might and power, mercy and generosity, essence (ʿayn) and existence (wujūd), and the beautiful face (al-wajhu dhū'l-jamāl) and the sublime measure (al-qadru dhū'l-jalāl). He is the One, Most High. His grandeur is His garment, His loftiness His brilliance, His magnificence His exaltedness, His being His essence, His eternity without beginning His everlasting eternity, His timelessness His endless eternity, His truth (al-ḥaqq) His self (al-nafs), and His permanence His essence. His perpetuity is His remaining, His decree (qa?āÌ) His fate (qadar), His sublimity His beauty, His prohibition His command, His wrath His mercy, and His desire (irāda) His will (mashīÌa). He is the King by His invincibility (jabarūt) and the One in His dominion (malakūt). God the blessed and glorified! Glory be to Him, how weighty is His affair!</text>
      <text>[Section] The Real (swt) knows the intensity of the spiritual desire (irāda) of His friends to praise and extol Him and their inability to perform the praise due to Him in accordance with His exaltedness and radiance. Therefore He informed them that He has praised Himself in the opening of His address in His words, Praise be to God, and they are revived after being lowly and experience life after deadening, and their innermost selves take on the perfection of strength [through God], for they have heard the praise of the Real about the Real in the speech of the Real.</text>

      <text>The Compassionate, the Merciful</text>
      <text>Both names are derived from mercy (raḥma). Mercy is an eternal attribute and it is the [divine] desire for blessing (irāda al-niʿma). According to the experts (ahl al-taḥqīq), these are two nouns denoting intensification with no distinction between the two [in terms of the recipients of the mercy].</text>
      <text>It is said the compassionate (al-raḥmān) is the more emphatic and more complete in expressiveness. Nothing other than the Real (s) is called raḥmān without restriction, while the merciful (al-raḥīm) can be used to describe others. By means of His mercy the servant comes to know that He is the Compassionate. If not for His mercy no one would know that He is the Compassionate. Whether mercy is the desire for blessing or the blessing itself, as some would have it, the blessings themselves are varied and their degrees are different, for one blessing is a blessing for bodily forms (ashbāḥ) and outward circumstances (ẓawāhir) and the other blessing is a blessing for spirits (arwāḥ) and inner secrets of the heart (sarāÌir).</text>
      <text>In the system of those who distinguish between the two, the Compassionate (raḥmān) is a specific term with a general meaning, while the Merciful (raḥīm) is a general term with a specific meaning: As the Compassionate, He provides comfort for all people in their external circumstances while the Merciful grants success to the believers for the life of the inner secrets of their hearts (sarāÌir). He is the Compassionate by that which He gives in comfort (rawwaḥa) and the Merciful by that which He gives in glimmers (lawwaḥa). Giving comfort (tarwīḥ) is through acts of beneficence (mabārr) and the giving of glimmers (talwīḥ) is through lights (anwār). The Compassionate is with the unveiling of His manifestation (tajallī) while the Merciful is with the kindness of His being a friend and protector (tawallī). The Compassionate is with what He gives in faith (īmān) and the Merciful is with what He confers in knowledge (ʿirfān). Or the Compassionate is with what He grants in knowledge (ʿirfān) and the Merciful is with what He undertakes in forgiveness (ghufrān). Or the Compassionate is with what He gives in blessing in forgiveness (ghufrān) and the Merciful is with what He bestows in good pleasure (ri?wān). Or the Compassionate is with what He honors in good pleasure and the Merciful is with what He gives in blessing in vision and eyewitnessing (ʿiyān).</text>

      <text>Master of the day of Judgement.</text>
      <text>The master (mālik) is the one to whom sovereignty (mulk) belongs. The sovereignty of the Real (swt) is His power over creating (ibdāʿ). Master (mālik) is a more intensive form than King (malik) and He (s) is both King and Master and sovereignty is His. Just as there is no god but He, there is none with the power to create except Him. He is alone in His divinity and singular in His sovereignty. He rules the souls of His worshippers (ʿābidīn) for He has granted agency to them (ṣarrafahā) in His service. He rules the hearts of the knowers (ʿārifīn) for He honors them (sharrafahā) with knowledge of Him. He rules the souls of the seekers (qāṣidīn) for He holds them in his thrall (tayyamahā). He rules the hearts of the ecstatics (wājidūn) for He bewilders them (hayyamahā). He rules the bodily forms (ashbāḥ) of those who worship Him and He is kind to them with his gifts and favors. He rules the spirits (arwāḥ) of those whom He loves and He unveils the attribute of His majesty to them and the quality of His beauty. [He is] the King of the reins of the lords of the profession of unity and He turns them about wherever He wills as He wills and He grants them success wherever He wills as He wills. He does not entrust them to themselves for even a moment. He does not transfer power to them in their affair for even the shortest period of time. He is for them in place of themselves and He has annihilated them from themselves to Him.</text>
      <text>[Section] His beneficence rules the hearts of the worshippers and they desire His gifts. His authority rules the hearts of those who declare unity and they are content with His abiding. He teaches the lords of the profession of union that He is their master (mālik) and their free choice (ikhtiyār) drops away from them. They come to know that the servant has no ownership, and the one who has no ownership has no governing power (ḥukm), and the one who has no governing power has no free choice. There is no turning away (iʿrā?) from obedience to Him for them and no resistance (iʿtirā?) to His governing power.</text>

      <text>You [alone] we worship, and You [alone] we ask for help.</text>
      <text>Its meaning is 'we worship You and we ask for help through You', but beginning with the mention of the object of worship is better than beginning with the mention of the servant's attribute, which is his worship and seeking help. This is a more eloquent wording and more pleasing to the ears. Worship is bringing the utmost humility in harmony (muwāfaqa) with the command, standing wherever the law stands, and asking for help in seeking the assistance of the Real.</text>
      <text>Worship (ʿibāda) refers to the exertion of effort and strength, while asking for help (istiʿāna) indicates seeking to attract power and grace. So in worship the honor of the servant becomes manifest and in asking for help kindness comes to the servant. The finding of his honor is in worship and the granting of security from harm is in the asking for help. The outward aspect of worship is humbling oneself (tadhallul) but its inward truth is becoming powerful (taʿazzuz) and beautiful (tajammul):</text>
      <text>When necks are brought low (dhallalat)</text>
      <text>in being brought near,</text>
      <text>between us, their glory (ʿizz)</text>
      <text>is in their humility (dhull).</text>
      <text>Its meaning is:</text>
      <text>As soon as you caused me</text>
      <text>to submit to dhāl and lām</text>
      <text>You met me</text>
      <text>in ʿayn and zā.</text>
      <text>[Section] Worship is the promenade of the seekers (qāṣidūn), the recreation of the aspirants (murīdūn), the meadow of intimacy for the lovers (muḥibbūn) and the pasture of delight for the knowers (ʿārifūn). Their eyes are cooled by [worship], their hearts find joy in it, and their spirits have rest from it. [The Prophet] (ṣ) alluded to this in saying, 'Give us rest, O Bilāl'. One created being said about another created being:</text>
      <text>O people, my blood revenge</text>
      <text>belongs to my AsmāÌ</text>
      <text>Anyone near and far</text>
      <text>knows it.</text>
      <text>Do not call upon me</text>
      <text>except by 'O servant of her'</text>
      <text>For that is the most truthful</text>
      <text>of my names.</text>
      <text>Asking for help is to alight in the environs of His generosity, to put your burden down in the courtyard of His liberality, and to submit your burden to the hand of His rule. So you seek Him full of hope, taking large strides towards Him, hoping in Him with a powerful anticipation, having faith in His eternal generosity, trusting in what has already been chosen (ikhtiyār sābiq), and clinging to the strong rope of His liberality.</text>

      <text>Guide us to the straight path.</text>
      <text>Guidance (hidāya) is to direct (irshād) and its basic meaning is to influence someone's inclinations. The one who is guided is one who is aware of the Real (s) and prefers His good pleasure and has faith in Him. The command in this verse is elided, for the meaning is 'Say: Guide us'. The believers are already being rightly guided in the present moment, so the meaning is to petition for ongoing and ever increasing [guidance]. The straight path is the true path upon which are the people who declare God's oneness. The meaning of guide us is 'cause us to incline to You', 'take us as Yours', 'be our guide (dalīl) to You', 'facilitate our way to You', 'arouse our aspiration for You' and 'bring our concerns together through You'.</text>
      <text>[Section] 'Prevent our innermost selves from witnessing all others (aghyār). Show in our hearts the risings of lights (anwār). Keep our seeking of You from the blemish of traces or effects (āthār). And cause us to rise from the way stations of studying and reasoning to the gathering together (jamʿ) on the plains of nearness and communion.'</text>
      <text>[Section] 'Take away our comfort with simulacra and outward appearances through the intimate kindnesses and secrets you share with us in finding communion and witnessing the sublime and beautiful.'</text>
      <text>[Section] 'Direct us to the Real so that we will not put our trust in the intermediaries of [our] deeds, and so that the dust of vain opinions and suppositions will not fall upon the face of professing divine unity'.</text>
      <text>Guide us to the straight path, i.e., 'remove from us the darkness of our states so that we may be illuminated by the lights of Your holiness from the shadows of our own seeking. And lift from us the shadow of our effort so that we may gain insight by the stars of Your liberality and find You through You'.</text>
      <text>[Section] 'Guide us to the straight path so that no associate from Satan's insinuations and whisperings, and no friend from the inclinations and murmurings of the lower selves become our companions. Let not any stay in the familiar territories of blind following (taqlīd) keep us from communion. Do not let reliance on routine instruction come between us and insight.</text>

      <text>Alif lām mīm.</text>
      <text>According to some people, these isolated letters at the beginning of the sura are among the ambiguous [verses], the interpretation (taÌwīl) of which is known only to God. They say every book has a mystery and the mystery of God in the QurÌān is these isolated letters.</text>
      <text>According to other people they are acronyms for His Names: the alif is from the Name 'Allah', the lām indicates His Name al-laṭīf ('the Subtle'), and the mīm indicates His Names al-majīd ('the Glorious') and al-malik ('the King').</text>
      <text>It is said God made an oath by means of these letters, an honor they hold because they are the basic elements of His Names and His Speech.</text>
      <text>It is said that they are the names of suras [of the QurÌān].</text>
      <text>It is said that the alif indicates the Name Allāh, the lām indicates the name Jibrīl (Gabriel), and the mīm indicates the name Muḥammad (ṣ), since this Book descended from God upon the tongue of Gabriel to Muḥammad (ṣ).</text>
      <text>Among the [Arabic] letters, alif is independent (infaradat) in its form because it does not connect to other letters in writing; all but a few of the letters connect. By contemplating this quality, the servant becomes aware of the need of all creation for Him and His Self-sufficiency from all.</text>
      <text>It is said that the sincere servant remembers from the status of the alif the absolute freedom of the Real (swt) from being particularized by place. All of the letters have a place in the throat, the lip or the tongue, etc., for articulation, except alif. It is His 'His-ness' (huwiya) without being ascribed to any place.</text>
      <text>It is said the allusion in [the alif] is to the servant's standing alone (infirād) for God (swt) so that he will be like the alif which is not connected to any letter, and will not abandon the state of standing straight and upright before Him.</text>
      <text>It is said that at His address alif, the servant is called in his innermost self to withdraw (infirād) the heart to God Most High. At His address lām, he is asked to yield (līn) to Him in considering His due. Upon hearing the mīm he is asked to conform (muwāfaqa) to His command regarding that which has been entrusted to him.</text>

      <text>That Book, in it there is no doubt.</text>
      <text>It is said that Book means 'this Book'.</text>
      <text>[On the other hand] it is said [that Book] is an allusion to what preceded its revelation in the [divine] Speech.</text>
      <text>It is [also] said [that it means] 'that Book whose revelation I promised to you on the Day of the Covenant'.</text>
      <text>In it there is no doubt for this is the time of its revelation. It is said: 'that Book within which I prescribed mercy on Myself for your community - there is no uncertainty [regarding that] for it has been verified by what I have said'.</text>
      <text>It is said [that Book is] the Book that is My predetermination (sābiq ḥukmī) and My eternal decree (qadīm qa?āÌī), because in it there is no doubt regarding those for whom I have determined happiness or have sealed with wretchedness.</text>
      <text>It is said [it means]: 'My determination is what I have said: there is no uncertainty in the fact that My mercy precedes My wrath.'</text>
      <text>It is said [it is] an allusion to the faith, knowledge, love and goodness that is written in the hearts of His friends. Surely the Book of the lovers is something cherished by the lovers, especially when deprived of meeting. In the Book of the lovers, there is their consolation and intimacy, their healing and refreshment. With respect to this, they recite:</text>
      <text>Your writing is all around me,</text>
      <text>it doesn't leave my bed</text>
      <text>There is healing in it for that</text>
      <text>which I am concealing.</text>
      <text>They also recite:</text>
      <text>The book brought</text>
      <text>what is most cooling to our eyes,</text>
      <text>a healing for hearts;</text>
      <text>thereby the utmost limits of desires are granted.</text>
      <text>People divided happiness</text>
      <text>into portions</text>
      <text>amongst themselves.</text>
      <text>The most fortunate of them was I.</text>
      <text>[2:2 cont'd] A guidance for the God-fearing.</text>
      <text>i.e., an explanation and proof, a light and a highway, for those whom the Real (swt) has protected from the darknesses of ignorance, and given insight with the lights of the intellect, and selected for the realities of connecting (waṣl). This Book for the friends (awliyāÌ) is a healing (shifāÌ) and for the enemies (aʿdāÌ) a blindness and affliction (balāÌ). The one who is God-fearing (muttaqin) is one who fears (ittaqā) looking to his own God-fearing (taqwā); he does not rely on it nor does he consider that he can be saved except through the grace of his Protector.</text>

      <text>Who believe in the Unseen, and maintain the prayer</text>
      <text>The true meaning of belief (imān) is affirmation (taṣdīq) and then actualization (taḥqiq), both of which are brought about by God's granting of success (tawfīq). The affirmation is in the contract (ʿaqd) and actualization is through the exertion of effort (jahd) in preserving the covenant (ʿahd) and observing the limit (ḥadd). The believers are those who affirm (ṣaddaqū) their commitment (iʿtiqād) and then are sincere (ṣadaqū) in their effort (ijtihād).</text>
      <text>As for the Unseen, what the servant knows of it is limited to what is necessary. The servant understands each religious matter by a kind of reasoning (istidlāl), a mode of reflective consideration (fikr), and testimonial witness (istishhād), so the belief is invisible (ghaybī) within it. The Lord (swt) is unseen (ghayb) and what the Real speaks about with regards to the gathering and the resurrection, the reward and the place of return, and the reckoning and punishment, is unseen.</text>
      <text>It is said that only someone who has the lamp of the Unseen with him believes. Those who are supported by the demonstrative proof of intellects believe through the evidence of knowledge and the sign of certitude. The veracity of reasoning brings them to the courtyards of insight, and what is correct in testimonial witness carries them to the elevated observation points of stillness. Their faith in the Unseen comes through the types of knowledge (ʿulūm) they possess, crowding out the causes of doubt. [Others] receive instruction (taʿrīf) through curtains of lights He has lowered down over them. Through the glimmers of perspicuity (bayān), He has freed them from the need for any thought and reflection, any seeking of pure intuitions (khawāṭir dhakiyya) or rejection of ignoble urgings (dawāʿin radiyya). The suns of their innermost selves rise and they no longer have any need for the lamps of their reasoning. Regarding this they have recited:</text>
      <text>From your face my night has become</text>
      <text>the sun of the bright morning.</text>
      <text>The darkness is elsewhere,</text>
      <text>in the air.</text>
      <text>People are in</text>
      <text>the twilight of darkness.</text>
      <text>While we, from your face,</text>
      <text>are in the bright morning light.</text>
      <text>They also recite:</text>
      <text>The sun of the one who loves you</text>
      <text>has appeared at night.</text>
      <text>It has become illuminated</text>
      <text>since she does not set.</text>

      <text>and who believe in what has been revealed to you; and what was revealed before you; and of the Hereafter, they are certain.</text>
      <text>Their belief in the Unseen necessarily requires their belief in the QurÌān and in what God has revealed in the books before the QurÌān, but He repeats the mention of belief here for the purposes of specification and corroboration. The affirmation (taṣdīq) of the intermediary (ṣ) in some of what he has communicated makes the affirmation of him obligatory in all that he has communicated, since the evidence of his sincerity bears witness generally without any restriction. They have certainty in the Hereafter because they have witnessed the Unseen: When the Messenger of God (ṣ) asked Ḥāritha, 'How is your state?' He said, 'I have become one who submits to God in truth and it is as if I were with the people of the Garden exchanging visits, and as if I were with the people of the Fire clamoring to one another, and as if I were with the throne of my Lord in plain sight. The Messenger of God (ṣ) said, 'You have it right, so keep to it'.</text>
      <text>ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays said, 'If the veil were to be lifted, it would not increase my certainty'. The real meaning of certainty is to rid yourself of indecisive guessing and to stay far away from loose conjecturing.</text>

      <text>Those are upon guidance from their Lord; those are the ones that will prosper</text>
      <text>It means '[those are] in possession of clear evidence, certainty, unveiling and realization from their Lord'. He discloses Himself to their hearts first by His signs, then by His attributes, and then by His reality and Essence.</text>
      <text>Some people are upon guidance from their Lord by means of rational proofs (dalāÌil al-ʿuqūl). They apply [these proofs] properly and therefore attain truths of different types of knowledge (ḥaqāÌiq al-ʿulūm). Other people possess insight (baṣīra) into the courtesies of drawing near, so that through witnessing the mercy and generosity [of God] they attain the perspicuity (bayān) of certainty. The truth appears to others in their innermost selves so that they witness the reality of the eternally sought and impenetrable (ṣamadiyya), and they attain to the source of the faculty of insight by virtue of mystical knowledge (ʿirfān).</text>
      <text>Those are the ones that will prosper: Prosperity is to attain what is wanted and win what is sought. The folk have attained subsistence (baqāÌ) at the place of meeting and have achieved victory in subduing the enemies that are the clamor of random thoughts (hawājis) in the lower self. Then the ideas (khawāṭir) that come to hearts disappear and they stand by the Real for the Real without the intermediary of an intellect (ʿaql) or recourse to memory (dhikr) or thought (fikr).</text>

      <text>As for the disbelievers, alike it is for them whether you have warned them or have not warned them, they do not believe.</text>
      <text>Those who are veiled by the covering of their own qualities are kept from witnessing His truth. The allusion here is that both are the same to them - the words of one who tries to lead them to the Real (ḥaqq) or the words of one who aids them in seeking to attract worldly fortune (ḥaẓẓ). Nay, they are more inclined to the calls to heedlessness and prefer to pay attention to them. How could they not, when they are marked with the branding of separation, locked in the prison of absence, and barred from the place of nearness. None of them will attain faith (īmān) because there is no granting of security (amān) for them from the Real. Because they have not been granted security (lam yuÌmanū) they do not believe (lam yuÌminū). A determination God has already made is unalterable and a word from Him is final. (God's) power cannot be opposed. Fearsome attacks will surprise those who contest the Real in the matter and the decree will catch them unawares.</text>
      <text>It is said that the disbeliever does not desist from his straying because of the misery that is already his. Likewise the one who is bound by the shackles of his lower self is veiled from witnessing His Unseen and His Reality, for he cannot see the right way or pursue the right course. It is said that for the one who remains in the darknesses of his foolishness, equal to him are the advice of sound guides and the fictions of those who speak falsely, for God has removed from his states the blessings of being able to judge between two things. He does not come with an ear to acceptance and pays little attention to the caller to right conduct. As it is said:</text>
      <text>My sincere advice (naṣīḥatī)</text>
      <text>is the concern of sincere (naṣūḥ).</text>
      <text>The disobedience of the sincere</text>
      <text>is My concern.</text>

      <text>God has set a seal on their hearts, and on their hearing; and on their eyes is a covering; and for them will be a mighty chastisement.</text>
      <text>The seal on something prevents anything from entering it or coming out. Similarly, the Real (s) has determined that the ignorance and error in the hearts of His enemies will not be removed, nor will any insight or guidance enter into them. There is a covering of forsakenness over the hearing of their hearts. The faculties of hearing have been blocked from receiving the speech of the Real with respect to belief, so the whisperings of Satan and the murmurings (hawājis) of their lower selves distract [the heart] from listening to the intuitions (khawāṭir) that come from the Real. As for the elect, the intuitions that come from different kinds of knowledge (ʿulūm) and preoccupation with the results to questions in their hearts distract their hearts from the secrets of the Real coming to them without intermediary. That is only for the elect of the elect. For this reason the Messenger of God (ṣ) said, 'There have been inspired men (muḥaddatḥūn) in communities and if there is any in my community, it is ʿUmar'. This inspired one is singled out from the elect just as the possessor of different types of knowledge is singled out from among ordinary people. There is a covering over the eyes of outsiders so they will not see either by the 'sight' (baṣar) of different kinds of knowledge or by the insight (baṣīra) of realities. And for them will be a mighty chastisement because of their supposing that they have something and their forgetfulness of what they have been given in tribulation in the present and the end, which is their separation (furqa) in the here and now, and their burning (ḥurqa) in what is to come.</text>

      <text>And some people there are who say, 'We believe in God and the Last Day'; but they are not believers.</text>
      <text>They stayed firm in their hypocrisy and persisted in deceiving the Muslims, so God tore off their veils by His saying 'but they are not believers'. Thus it is said:</text>
      <text>Whoever adorns himself with something</text>
      <text>other than what he has inside,</text>
      <text>the test exposes</text>
      <text>what he is pretending.</text>
      <text>When their words were stripped of their meanings, the harm they received from them was greater than the benefit they imagined in them, for God Most High said, 'Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire' [4:145] and if it were not for their hypocrisy, their punishment would not have been increased.</text>
      <text>It is said that when they lacked sincerity in their states, sincere words were of no benefit to them. God Most High said, 'God bears witness that the hypocrites truly are liars' [63:1] while they used to say, 'We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of God'. In a similar way, the one who publicizes from himself what he has not yet realized will immediately be exposed before the masters of realization. It has been said:</text>
      <text>O you who claim</text>

      <text>The harm of their deception and the punishment for it comes back to themselves, so it is as if they deceived themselves in actuality, for they but treated their own value lightly and belittled themselves. No one suffered the harm of their actions but themselves and they cut off their own lifeblood. When there is one who knows the true nature of things, the one who desires to deceive him only deceives himself.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this verse is to the one who has forgotten His prior kindness. He says, 'mine, through me, from me and I', slandering in his delusion and conjecture [what should be] 'Yours, through You, from You, and You'. This delusion is the most difficult of punishments because he sees a mirage (sarāb) and thinks it is drink (sharāb) until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing, and he finds God there, Who pays him his account in full [24:39].</text>

      <text>In their hearts is a sickness; and God has increased their sickness; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie.</text>
      <text>In the hearts of the hypocrites is the sickness of making partners [with God] (shirk) and God increases their sickness in their imagining that they have been saved by deceiving the Muslims. The pain of their grievous punishment will reach them in the end. The allusion pertains to whoever has confused his ultimate objective (qaṣd) with his worldly concerns (ḥaẓẓ) and mixed his spiritual desire (irāda) with his whims (hawā), taking one step forward with spiritual desire and one step backward with worldly concerns and following the lower self. He is neither a sincere seeker (murīd) nor permanently neglectful. If the hypocrites had been sincere in their beliefs, they would have been safe from the punishment in the Hereafter just as they were safe from paying the jizya tax and the like in this world in the manner of polytheists and dhimmis. Similarly, if the seeker (murīd) had been sincere in his spiritual desire, he would have reached out in his heart to the realities of communion and the blessings of sincerity would have reached him in attaining what he desired. But his state is as it has been said:</text>
      <text>We have not been firm</text>
      <text>but justice will be firm with us without bending.</text>
      <text>If we had been sincere (khalaṣnā),</text>
      <text>we would have been saved (takhallaṣnā) from tribulation.</text>
      <text>Anyone whose worship has become weak has a barrier between him and the degrees of the Gardens (darajāt al-jannāt). Anyone whose spiritual desire has become weak has a barrier between him and the intimate communications of nearness and whispered confidences (muwāṣalāt al-qurb wa'l-munājāt). As for those who rely on this world and follow whims, their reliance on the abode of illusion is an illness of their hearts. The increase in their disease will be as the increase in their greed. The more they find something from [this world], the more their greed multiplies for what they have not found, hastening the punishment for them.</text>
      <text>Therefore, among the immediate punishments for them is the scattering of their concerns, and then their lives becoming troublesome. They are kept by [these punishments] from their Protector (mawlā). There will be no enjoyment for them nor rest in what they have preferred in following their own whims.</text>

      <text>When it is said to them, 'Do not corruption in the land', they say, 'We are only putting things right'. * Truly, they are the agents of corruption, but they perceive not.</text>
      <text>The allusion in it is to the fact that when thoughts of warning came secretly to their hearts, calling them to right conduct, they followed self-indulgent interpretation (rukhaṣ al-taÌwīl) and deceived themselves about that which bore witness to the hardness of their hearts. When they denied the proof of the Real in the thoughts that came to their hearts, God took away the blessing from their states and gave them in its place a deaf ear to the Real. Their affliction is in their resistance to the path (ṭarīqa) and their loss of belief in it.</text>
      <text>Just as an apostate is a more intense enemy to Muslims, so the one who returns from spiritual desire (irāda) to the world and ordinary custom is the worst of people in rejecting this path, and the most distant from its followers. As the proverb goes, 'Anyone who looses their stored grain to fire wishes the same for others'. According to the sincere among those [on the path], the help of those who have deserted the way of spiritual desire is not to be accepted, just as the Messenger (ṣ) did not accept the almsgiving (zakāt) of Thaʿlaba.</text>
      <text>It is said the exposure of those who lie is sufficient, by saying to such a one's face, 'You have lied'. When they said, 'We are only putting things right', the Real (s) showed them to be liars and He said, 'Truly, they are the agents of corruption, but they perceive not', meaning 'We are aware of them and have exposed them'.</text>

      <text>The allusion in it is to the hypocrites who, when they were called to the Real, described the Muslims as foolish. Similarly, when the wealthy are commanded to renounce this world, they describe the people of right conduct as lazy and weak. They say the poor (fuqarāÌ) have nothing because they have no wealth, no status, no comfort and no livelihood. In truth, they are the poor and they are the possessors of tribulation. They have fallen into ignominy out of fear of ignominy, and struggled with abasement out of fear of abasement. They have constructed castles (quṣūr) but have lived in tombs (qubūr. They have adorned the cradle (mahd) but have been wrapped in the grave (lahd). They have galloped in the fields of heedlessness (ghafla) but have stumbled in the wadis of grief (ḥasra). Soon they will come to know but at that time their knowledge will not benefit them. Nothing will be of use to them.</text>

      <text>When they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe'; but when they go apart to their devils they say, 'We are with you; we were only mocking'. * God [Himself] mocks them, leaving them in their insolence, bewildered.</text>
      <text>The hypocrites wanted to combine their relations with disbelievers with their companionship with Muslims, so when they appeared before Muslims they said, 'We are with you' and when they were alone with those like them among the disbelievers, they voiced their loyalty to them. They wanted to combine the two situations but they were excluded from both. God Most High said, 'Wavering, all the time - not to these, neither to those' [4:143]. Similarly, anyone who wants to combine the path of spiritual desire (irāda) and what he has from the people of habit (ahl al-ʿāda), [should know that] these cannot go together since two opposites cannot be combined. 'The servant who has contracted with his master to be freed is still a servant to the last dirham'. When night draws nigh, day slips away. Anyone who has a hodgepodge (khalīṭ) in every corner (nāḥiyya) and a heart bound (rabīṭ) in every nook (zāwiyya) is headed for disaster. First one group and then another take turns dwelling in his heart, so that it is forever ruined. There is no pleasure for him in life nor does he possess any provision from his heart in truth. The one who spoke for them said:</text>
      <text>I see you as someone left over</text>
      <text>from the people of Moses</text>
      <text>for they do not wait</text>
      <text>patiently for food.</text>
      <text>When the hypocrites said, 'we were only mocking', God Most High said, 'God [Himself] mocks them', i.e., He requites them for their mocking. Similarly when the people put their reins in the hands of carnal desires, they are lured into the wadis of separation. Their feet are not firmly planted in a place, so they wander in the labyrinth of absence. Just as he leaves the hypocrites in their insolence, bewildered, he prolongs the period of their confused hopes. So when the time of their deaths draw nigh, their hopes are at their highest, while their actions are at their worst. That is the requital for what they did and the noxious result of what they produced. The beautification of their ugly acts in their eyes is the worst of their punishments, and their being content with their listlessness is their greatest misfortune.</text>

      <text>Those are they who have bought error for guidance; so their commerce has not profited them; nor are they guided.</text>
      <text>The allusion in it is that those who have neglected what is due (ḥuqūq) by remaining in the familiar territories of worldly fortunes (ḥuẓūẓ) have lost their bargain, so their commerce has not profited them. Those who are content with this world over the next are in manifest loss. Those who prefer this world or the next over the Real have the most intense loss. Although the one who suffers the loss of [the Gardens] of bliss will come up short, the one who is afflicted with distance from intimate conversation and with disengagement in his heart from his Protector, who remains in the captivity of carnal desires with no messenger to his heart, no attainment for his spirit, no intimate conversation with Him, no approach to Him, no witnessing in his innermost self - this is the one who [truly] suffers and is afflicted. If even a moment slips away, his Lord has slipped away. Moments have no substitutes or alternates. Thus someone said:</text>

      <text>Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire, and when it illumined all about him God took away their light and left them in darkness, unable to see,</text>
      <text>The similitude God (s) strikes here for hypocrites is that of someone who kindles a fire in the beginning of the night, then the fire is extinguished and he is left in the darkness. Similarly, something of the benefits of this world appear to the hypocrites outwardly but then they are afflicted in the Hereafter by the pain of the punishment. Or [it may be that] something of their affirmation (iqrār) flashes, but then they remain in the darkness of their denial (inkār).</text>
      <text>The allusion in this verse is to one who has a beautiful beginning travelling the path of spiritual desire (ṭarīq al-irāda). He toils for a time and endures one difficulty after another. He then returns to this world before having reached the truth and reverts to the darknesses of human nature within him. His stem sprouted but did not bear fruit. His branch blossomed but did not ripen. He hastened the eclipse of listlessness over the moons of His presence. The hand of subjugation has rejected him after the tongue of kindness beckoned him. His heart has moved away from closeness and his lower self has become full of rancor towards the seekers. He is as it is said:</text>
      <text>When passion settled in</text>
      <text>and we said we were happy,</text>
      <text>we thought we were secure</text>
      <text>from growing apart.</text>
      <text>Division sent its messengers</text>
      <text>in secret</text>
      <text>and destroyed what we had brought together</text>
      <text>in our union.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this verse also pertains to one who possesses the lowest level of meanings but puts forth claims far above what he has. When the ongoing increase he possesses in his states is cut off, he remains in the darkness of his claims.</text>
      <text>There is also the one who relies on the rubble and glitter of this world. When [his] states have become like a well-trodden road, helped along by hope and rising expectation, death appears from the ambushes of the divine ruse. He leaves everything (yatruk al-kull) but carries the burden forth (yaḥmil al-kall).</text>

      <text>Or as a cloudburst out of the heaven in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightening - they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, cautious of death; and God encompasses the disbelievers.</text>
      <text>The meaning of His saying, 'Or', is because He gives either one of these two similitudes for [the hypocrites]. He compares the QurÌān to rain descending from the heaven and compares the promises and threats in the QurÌān to the thunder and lightening in the rain. He compares their seeking refuge in fleeing from hearing the QurÌān, their distancing themselves from attentiveness, and their neglect in trying to gain insight, to those who put their fingers in their ears against hearing the sounds of thunder. Similarly, the allusion is to the heedless when the admonitions of those who admonish reach their ears, or the lights of felicity shine on their hearts. If they would desist from their blind heedlessness, they would be happy. But they keep each other distracted by false hopes and have resolved upon their corrupt path. They make weak excuses and swear by God, 'Had we been able, we would have gone forth with you', destroying their souls [9:42] and they bring about the destruction by their own hands.</text>
      <text>Truly when the noble one</text>

      <text>he veils the ugly</text>

      <text>Similarly, when the one who is tired</text>

      <text>Part of the similitude of the hypocrites - as also the heedless - is that when they attend the places of admonition, or their hearts incline to gentleness, or some terror overwhelms them, their states move closer to repentance and their longing to turn [to God] becomes stronger. But when they revert to their own planning and seek counsel from those close to them, their family and offspring urge them to return to their world. They offer their advice, frightening them with weakness and dependency, so that their resolve becomes weak, their spiritual desire (irāda) declines and they become as it is said:</text>
      <text>Whenever he repents</text>
      <text>he returns to his ignorance,</text>
      <text>just as the one who is feeble</text>
      <text>suffers a relapse.</text>
      <text>He said, 'had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and sight', meaning the outward hearing and seeing of the hypocrites as well as their being deaf and blind inwardly. Similarly, the heedless and those who are content with the external aspects of Islam - God Most High has the power to negate the positive outcome (tawfīq) of their practice of outward acts of obedience (ẓāhir al-ṭāʿāt), just as He has the power to negate the realization (taḥqīq) of what they have discovered from the purest of states (ṣafāÌ al-ḥālāt).</text>

      <text>Worship is becoming harmonious (muwāfaqa) with the command and it is pouring all energy into requests (taḥqīq) for realization of the Unseen. The declaration of oneness (tawḥīd) enters one through the heart, disengagement (tajrīd) through the innermost self, becoming single-minded (tafrīd) through intention, and humility through the soul. The surrender (istislām) is to the decree (ḥukm).</text>
      <text>It is said, 'worship Him' by renouncing prohibited things, persevering in performing acts of obedience, welcoming obligatory acts with humility and lowliness, and avoiding detours in the way stations of laziness and indifference.</text>
      <text>His saying 'so that you may be fearful' is to bring the command closer to them and to make it easier. By the word 'may' He keeps them at the bounds of fear and hope.</text>

      <text>He is made known to them by the mention of the favors He has granted in the creation of the heaven for them as a roof raised (saqf marjūʿ), the establishment of the earth for them as a couch laid out (farsh maw?ūʿ), and the bringing forth of plants by the rain for them as a provision gathered (rizq majmūʿ). It is said He freed them from the favor of simulacra (amthāl) by eliminating from [the notion] of cause (ʿilla) that which is necessary. So the heaven is sufficient for them as a covering, the earth as a bed, the permissible things as provision, obedience as a trade, worship as an occupation, remembrance as an intimate friend, and the Lord as a guardian - so set not up compeers with God and do not attach your hearts to others in seeking what you need. The Real (swt) is One alone in creating, there is no originator other than Him. When you imagine anything in events beneficial or harmful, good or bad, as originating from a created thing, this is in actuality a kind of idolatry (shirk).</text>

      <text>He covered the eyes of outsiders so that they did not see His beloved (ṣ) and they wandered in the wadis of conjectures because they had lost the light of solicitude. The Messenger's bringing signs to them and making miracles appear only increased their doubts and suspicions. This is the way of those who have turned away from the Real (s). The illumination of proofs only increases their blindness to the truth. God Most High said, 'But signs and warners do not avail a folk who will not believe' [10:101]. In order to bring them to admit the proof, He informed them of their inability to compete with the miracle He gave them in the QurÌān, which conquered humankind from the first to the last. He made them acknowledge that even if they were to make common cause amongst themselves and strengthen themselves with others like them, and exert their utmost efforts and stratagems, they would not be able to bring a sura like any sura of the QurÌān. He said, 'If you do not' and then stated that they definitely did not have the capacity to do that and would not do it, for He said, 'and you will not'. This was as if He said, 'Look at yourselves and be wary of the idolatry which will bring you the punishment (ʿuqūba) of the fire, whose difficulty (ṣuʿūba) is such that its fuel is men and stones. If stones, with all their hardness, cannot withstand this fire, how can men with their weakness bear it? When the hearts of the believers became terribly concerned from hearing mention of the fire, He strengthened them and said, 'prepared for disbelievers'. In that is good news for the believers. This is the way of the Real (s). When He causes fear in His enemies, he brings glad tidings to His friends.</text>
      <text>Just as the deception of the disbelievers vanishes in encountering the miracles of the prophets (ʿa), similarly the claims of the confused disappear at the appearance of the lights of the truthful. The mark of the one who makes false claims is the return of driving cries (rujūʿ al-zajr) to the heart. The mark of the one with truthful intent is the occurrence of the subjugation (wuqūʿ al-qahr) of the heart. It is a rare individual who can distinguish between the two.</text>

      <text>The glad tidings of the Gardens are included to give information of the blessings awaiting the general body of believers, according to the description which is explained in the tafsīr literature. In addition to these blessings, He alludes to the glad tidings for the elite of immediate blessings which God has granted to them specifically. That which is to come is the Gardens of the reward (mathwaba) while these are the Gardens of nearness (qurba). Those are the meadows of recreation (nuzha) while these are the meadows of intimacy (zulfa). Those are the gardens of favors (af?āl) while these are the gardens of communion (wiṣāl). Those are the raising of degrees (darajāt) while these are the breath of intimate conversation (munājāt). That is the matter of His generosity (jūd) while this is independence through His existence (wujūd). That is the refreshment of mortal beings (abshār) while this is the promenade of the innermost selves (asrār). That is the kindness of giving to the external forms (ẓawāhir) while this is the unveiling of the covering from the innermost consciences (sarāÌir).

They will think that the second [time] will be like the first, but when they taste it they will find it beyond what came first. Similarly the states in the innermost consciousnesses of the people of realities are forever rising.

      <text>Being ashamed, for God Most High, means the relinquishment (tark) [of His free agency]. When He describes Himself as being ashamed of something, it means He does not do that, and when it is said, 'He is not ashamed', it means He does not mind doing that.</text>
      <text>Creation, in relation to the existence of the Real, is in actuality less than a speck of dust in the air (habāÌ fī hawāÌ) because this is the perishing of one limited thing in another. Therefore the two - the throne and the gnat - are the same in His power. The creation of the throne is not too troublesome or difficult for Him, nor is the creation of the gnat too insignificant or easy for him. He (s) is too holy to be attached to difficulty or ease. Since the matter can be described in this way, He is not ashamed to strike a similitude of the gnat, just as He is not ashamed to strike a similitude of the throne and what is below it.</text>
      <text>It is said one aspect of the similitude of the gnat is the fact that when it is hungry, it becomes strong and flies. When it is satiated, it splits open and dies. Similarly, Surely mankind goes too far, for he thinks himself self-sufficient [96:6-7].</text>
      <text>It is said or anything above it means a [larger] flying insect (dhubāb). One aspect of the allusion [here] is the insolence of the fly in that it keeps returning no matter how much it is driven away. If that [quality] was in the lion, no human being would be safe from him. But when He created power in the lion, He created in him an aversion to humankind. When He created the insolence in the fly, He created weakness in him, calling attention through this to the perfection of His wisdom and the effectiveness of His power.</text>
      <text>[2:26 cont'd] as for the believers, they know it is the truth from their Lord; but as for the disbelievers, they say, 'What did God desire by this for a similitude?'</text>
      <text>As for those for whom the eyes of their innermost consciousnesses have been opened, they do not look to others or to traces (āthār) unless it is with a view to crossing over (iʿtibār) or to increase the effectiveness of the faculty of insight (ibtiṣār).</text>

      <text>Those such as break the covenant with God after its solemn binding, and such as cut what God has commanded to be joined; and such as do corruption in the land - they shall be the losers.</text>
      <text>The allusion in it is to the state of one who has traveled the way of spiritual desire (irāda), then returned to what ordinary people have. He claimed to be willing to abandon his soul yet proved insincere when things became serious. He gave up allusions to reality (ishārāt al-ḥaqīqa) for concessions in the Sharīʿa (rukhaṣ al-sharīʿa). Just as the return of one who travels the way with his bodily self (nafs) is not praiseworthy so long as a dirham remains in his bag, so the return of one who quests with his heart (qalb) is not pleasing so long as a breath (nafas) remains in his spirit (rūḥ):</text>
      <text>Those who die</text>
      <text>following the religion of guidance</text>
      <text>find death</text>
      <text>a sweet watering place.</text>
      <text>And such as cut what God has commanded to be joined: The joining of the cords of the Real is through the cutting of the cords of creation. The joining of what belongs to Him is not completed without cutting what belongs to you. When the matter is the reverse, the opposite is the case.</text>
      <text>Among that which the servant has been commanded to join is the protection of the sacred relationship of the people of this path. What one expends to achieve [this joining] is through sincerity of concerns, not the offering of favors. [The servants'] concerned efforts are dedicated (mawqūfa) to connecting the cords of this path and arranging its conditions, while their hearts are directed (maṣrūfa) to the expectation of the guardianship of God Most High for its people. The corruption of this path in the land is their negligence of the margins of their situations and the edges of their affairs. They make themselves too busy to guide a novice (murīd) with their words and too busy to sharpen the aim of a seeker (qāṣid) with their concerned efforts. This is some of what displeases the Real (s) in them.</text>
      <text>Part of breaching the covenant is also that your innermost self turns away from witnessing Him for even a moment. Part of the cutting off of what you have been commanded to join is when even a breath of your worldly concerns enters at any time without upholding His right. Part of your corruption in the land is any hour which passes you in which you did not see Him. Surely that is the manifest loss, the grave trial, and the vast calamity.</text>

      <text>How do you disbelieve in God, when you were dead, and He gave you life; then He shall make you dead, then He shall give you life, then to Him you shall be returned!</text>
      <text>These are words to provoke astonishment and gravity in the servant. With the appearance of the signs, his heart should not incline to disbelief.</text>
      <text>It is said He makes Himself known to creation by the glimmers of His proofs and the flashes of His signs. He said, 'When you were dead', meaning a drop of sperm, its parts all the same, 'and He gave you life' as a human being with some of the parts of the sperm designated to be bone, some parts flesh, some parts hair, and some parts skin, etc.</text>
      <text>Then He shall make you dead in making you bones and fragments, then He shall give you life in raising you up after you were dead, then to Him you shall be returned, meaning to whatever He previously determined [for you] in happiness or misery.</text>
      <text>You were dead through your ignorance of Us, and He gave you life in your knowledge of Us, then He shall make you dead to your witnesses, then He shall give you life through Him in taking you from yourselves, then to Him you shall be returned, meaning to preserving the precepts of the law in carrying out what is due.</text>
      <text>It is said, you were dead because your lower selves remained and He gave you life through the annihilation of your lower selves, then He shall make you dead from yourselves from witnessing, so that you will not pay heed to [the annihilation] and corrupt yourselves. Then He shall give you life in taking you from yourselves, then to Him you shall be returned by your being turned about in His grasp (swt).</text>
      <text>It is said He holds their states in check so that there is no perpetual life and no complete annihilation. The more they say, 'this is life' - while they are thus - the more He turns them and annihilates them. Whenever they become annihilated, He affirms them and gives them subsistence, so they are forever between negation and affirmation, between subsistence and annihilation, and between wakefulness and erasure. His way is like this with them.</text>

      <text>He it is who created for you all that is in the earth;</text>
      <text>He made all created things subject to them in the sense of their obtaining benefit in each thing from them. They dwell on the earth, live under the sky, are guided by the stars, and benefit from every created thing in other ways. But they do not contemplate any perceived thing or effect (ʿayn wa athar) without recognizing the perfection of His power and the appearance of His lordship in it.</text>
      <text>It is said He has paved the way of knowing for them and awakened them to what He has singled out for them in beautiful action. Moreover He taught them the most sublime aspiration inasmuch as He claimed their works and states for Himself alone, for He said, 'Do not prostrate to the sun and moon [41:37]'.</text>
      <text>[2:29 cont'd] then He turned (istawā) to heaven and leveled them seven heavens and He has knowledge of all things.</text>
      <text>The things that have been brought into existence (akwān) are laid out in a uniform way (istawat) by His power; it is not that the Real (s) in His Essence sat Himself down (istawā) on any created thing. How could that be! Unicity (aḥadiyya) and Self-Sufficiency (ṣamadiyya) are His reality. What some have imagined regarding the possibility of Him being in a specific place is absurd since one 'sits' in a place but the Real (s) in His Essence does not sit in any place.</text>

      <text>And when your Lord said to the angels, 'I am appointing on earth a viceregent', they said, 'What, will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with praise and sanctify You?'; He said, 'Assuredly, I know what you know not'.</text>
      <text>This is the beginning of the disclosure of His secret regarding Adam and his progeny. He commanded clay to be extracted from every patch of ground and then commanded that it be left to ferment for forty mornings. Every one of the angels was full of amazement: 'What is the property (ḥukm) of this clay?' When He assembled [Adam's] form, they had never seen anything like it in marvelous craftsmanship and astonishing wisdom. So when He said, 'I am appointing on earth...', conjectures were thrown about, hearts were scattered and accusations were made. It was just as was said:</text>
      <text>How often I have seen</text>
      <text>someone beautiful</text>
      <text>but among mortals my choice</text>
      <text>has fallen upon you.</text>
      <text>It is said God (swt) created all the things He created, but did not say about any of them what He said about Adam, since He said, 'I am appointing on earth a viceregent'. The external sense of these words resembles mutual consultation, if it were to be among created beings. The Real (swt) created the Gardens with what is in them and the Throne with what it has in well-ordered parts and perfection of form, but He did not say, 'I am creating a throne or a garden or an angel'. But He said of Adam, 'I am appointing on earth a viceregent', as a way of conferring honor and distinction.</text>
      <text>[Section] The words of the angels, 'What, will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein?' were not an objection to the divine decree but rather a way of seeking understanding. To interpret the expression in such a way as to absolve the angels of any blame is more fitting, since they are sinless. God Most High said [in reference to the angels], 'Who do not disobey God in what He commands them' [66:6].</text>
      <text>It is said that in this speech the Real (s) brought out the hidden haughtiness of their obedience and the attention to their own acts in their hearts.</text>

      <text>And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then He presented them to the angels and said, 'Now tell Me the names of these if you speak truly'.</text>
      <text>The universality of His saying names necessarily implies the totality, and the connection of this word to all of them indicates comprehensiveness and verification. Just as He taught [Adam] the names of created things, all of them (according to what is articulated in the tafsīr of Ibn ʿAbbās and others), He also taught him the names of the Real (s). But He only disclosed to [the angels] the locus He chose for knowledge of the names of created things and by that [disclosure] the measure of [Adam's] superiority over them. As for his uniqueness in knowing His names (s), that was a secret which no angel who is nigh (malak muqarrab) was aware of. One who does not have a rank equal to Adam in knowing the names of created things, what hope could there be in his approaching the names of the Real and grasping the secrets of the Unseen? Since being selected for knowing the names of created things makes it proper for the angels to prostrate before him, what is one to think about being selected for knowing the names of the Real (s)? What is owed to the one who is honored with that?</text>
      <text>It is said the special status of the angels is in [their] glorification and sanctification [of God]. These acts of obedience are appropriate for created beings, for surely obedience is the mark of servants, and servants alone. [On the other hand], knowledge, in general, is a kind of commendation (madḥ) that is absolutely necessary in describing the Real (s), one that is not appropriate for anything other than Him. Among the category of created beings, there is no one more perfect in honoring Him than the one who honors Him through His own explanation of His attributes.</text>
      <text>It is said He honored [Adam] privately with what He taught him, and then explained His having selected him and having given him precedence on the day of the public revealing.</text>
      <text>It is said [that in the words] then He presented them, the [word] 'then' (thumma) is a particle of extension or delay. [It might refer] to Adam, in which case it means He gave him time for that which had been established in his heart and for the recognizing of what became known to him by His truth.</text>

Surely You are the Knower, Wise, i.e., what You do is true and sincere, there is none who can pass judgment over You, and there is no foolishness nor ugliness from You'.</text>

      <text>He said, 'Adam, tell them their names'; And when he had told them their names He said, 'Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen in the heavens and the earth?, And I know what you reveal and what you were hiding.'</text>
      <text>Among the traces of the divine solicitude to Adam (ʿa) is that when He said to the angels, 'Now tell Me' [2:31], they were seized with a fear of speaking, especially since He asked that they tell Him something their types of knowledge did not comprehend. But because of the information Adam (ʿa) had, [God] directed him to inform [the angels] and said, 'tell them their names', and Adam was not overly fearful in speaking to them. When Adam (ʿa) informed them of the names their types of knowledge lacked, his merit became apparent to them, and He said, 'Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen in the heavens and the earth?', meaning what the different types of knowledge of creation lack. 'And I know what you reveal regarding [your] acts of obedience and [what you] hide in believing in [your] superiority over Adam (ʿa)'.</text>
      <text>[Section] When the Real (s) wanted to choose Adam, He protected him, taught him, and showed him the effects of his care until he said what he said [about the names]. When He wanted to execute His decree regarding him, He caused forgetfulness to enter him so that he forgot His covenant in the presence and transgressed His limit. God Most High said, 'And We made a covenant with Adam before, but he forgot, and We did not find in him any constancy' (20:115). The moment which solicitude favored promoted knowledge and goodness completely, while the moment which made the decree take effect returned him to the state of forgetfulness and disobedience. Thus the decrees of the Real (s) are in what they make come and go. The worshipper is made lowly by His decree and He is doer of what He desires [11:107, 85:16].</text>
      <text>[Section] When they imagined obtaining preference for themselves by their glorification and sanctification, He informed them that the carpet of majesty is too holy to be adorned by the obedience of those who obey or to be defiled by the errors of stubborn deniers. Their returning to prostration before Adam made manifest [God's] freedom from need from any agreement or opposition [of created beings].</text>

      <text>And when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate yourselves to Adam; so they prostrated themselves, except Iblīs, who refused and disdained; and so he became one of the disbelievers.</text>
      <text>The prostration would not be a form of worship to [Adam], in and of himself, but rather a way of conforming to [God's] (s) command. It was as if their prostration to Adam was worship of God because it was by His command. It was a way of showing respect to Adam because He commanded them to do it to honor his affair. So it is as if that was a kind of submission to [Adam], but one that should not be called worship because the true meaning of worship is the utmost submission and that is not appropriate for anything but [God] (s).</text>
      <text>It is said He explained that His (s) sanctity is through His Own Majesty (jalāl), not through their acts. What accrues to them is the borrowing of this beauty (tajammul) by their [acts of] sanctification and glorification. He Who is exalted (yajillu) is the One Who has exalted Himself (ajallahu) by His Own exaltation (ijlālihi), not by their acts, and the One who is mighty has been made mighty by His (s) Own power. His power exalts beyond the exaltation of created beings (jalla ʿan ijlāl al-khalq qudruhu) and His mention is magnified beyond the magnification of created beings (ʿazza ʿan iʿzāz al-khalq dhikruhu).</text>
      <text>His words, 'So they prostrated themselves, except Iblīs': He refused in his heart (qalb) and disdained to prostrate with his self (nafs). He was among the disbelievers in [God's] prior determination and knowledge. In the time period in which Iblīs was emboldened by his obedience, he used to strut about in the vest of his conformity [to God's command and decree]. [The angels] acknowledged his superior rank and believed in the worthiness of his distinction. His affair became as it is said:</text>
      <text>The lamp of communion</text>
      <text>was shining between us.</text>
      <text>A wind of separation blew on it</text>
      <text>and it was extinguished.</text>
      <text>He used to consider himself deserving of the claim to superiority and worthy of nearness and special status.</text>
      <text>He passed the night well</text>
      <text>and the world was peaceful.</text>
      <text>He woke up one day</text>
      <text>and times had changed.</text>
      <text>No prior obedience benefited him, no previous reply freed him, no intercession of any intercessor reached him, and no prior solicitude held him fast. When fate prevails over someone, toil does not benefit (wa-man ghalabahu al-qa?āÌ lā yanfaʿahu al-ʿanāÌ). What originated from Adam was a human error so he experienced a singular mercy. But as for Iblīs, he experienced eternal misery and succumbed to fate and destiny. His hope was lost and his toil was in vain (khāba rajāÌuhu wa-?alla ʿanāÌuhu).</text>

      <text>And We said, 'Adam dwell and your wife in the Garden and eat thereof easefully where you desire; but do not come near this tree lest you be evildoers'.</text>
      <text>He settled him in the Garden but with his entry established the tree of the trial. If not for the prior decree, this blossoming tree would have been changed to a withered one, its greenery dried out, its existence forgotten, and Adam's hand would not have reached to its leaves to piece them together onto himself, and what happened to him would not have happened. If this tree had kept growing so that his hand could not reach it, all that confusion would not have occurred in his affair, but what had been predetermined appeared from the decree. There was no place better than the Garden, no human being more intelligent than Adam, no better counselor than the words of the allusion of the Real to him. There was nothing odd (gharība) from [Adam] before he did what he did, and no resolve (ʿaẓīma) more powerful than his resolve. But divine power cannot be contested and the decree cannot be opposed (wa-lakinna'l-qudrata lā tukābara wa'l-ḥukma lā yuʿāra?a).</text>
      <text>It is said when He said to him, 'dwell and your wife in the Garden and eat thereof easefully' there was an allusion to the fact that it is natural for created beings to dwell comfortably with other created beings, and to want to seek the good things of life. Alone, Adam (ʿa) had every good and well-being, but when one like him, the spouse, came, the fangs of sedition (anyāb al-fitna) appeared and the door to tribulation (bāb al-miḥna) was opened. When He dwelled together with Eve, he followed her in what she suggested to eat and what happened, happened. Indeed it is said:</text>
      <text>There is an ancient disease</text>
      <text>in the children of Adam,</text>
      <text>which is the youthful passion</text>
      <text>of one human being for another.</text>
      <text>[Section] Whenever anything is prohibited to the son of Adam, his urgings to approach it increase. Everything was permitted to Adam (ʿa) in the Garden - only one tree was prohibited. In what has been transmitted about this, there is no mention of his hand reaching out towards anything that was permitted to him. [Rather] he lost his patience and plunged into what was prohibited to him - this is the attribute of created beings.</text>

      <text>Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord and He relented to him; truly He is the Relenting, the Merciful.</text>
      <text>Certain words passed the lips of Adam with the Real (s) and certain words came from the Real (s) to Adam's ears. They have recited:</text>
      <text>When we are afraid</text>
      <text>of the eyes of observers,</text>
      <text>the secrets in the hearts</text>
      <text>speak.</text>
      <text>The Real (s) spoke in general terms about that [conversation] in order to keep the story veiled, or to leave open the possibility of equivocal meaning (iḥtimāl), different opinions (ẓunūn) and a place for interpretation (taÌwīl) regarding what it might mean.</text>
      <text>It is possible that the words of Adam (ʿa) might have been an excuse and vindication, and the words of the Real (s) were by way of acceptance and favor. According to the tafsīr traditions, His (t) words to him were, 'Are you in flight from me, O Adam?' Likewise, his words (ʿa) to Him were Our Lord we have wronged ourselves (7:23), and he said, 'Are You the one evicting me from the Garden?' He said, 'Yes'. Adam said, 'Will You return me to it?' and He said, 'Yes'.</text>
      <text>It is said when He commanded his expulsion from the Garden, He made what He told him in His exalted speech a provision so that it would be a remembrance and preparation [for his journey]:</text>
      <text>I remember the days of protection,</text>
      <text>then my liver</text>
      <text>goes weak from</text>
      <text>fear of being cut off.</text>
      <text>The conversations of lovers cannot be explained and outsiders will not fully understand them. By way of allusion (ishāra), and not by the meaning provided by commentary (tafsīr) or interpretation (taÌwīl), the decree for the Unseen was thus. The Real (s) wanted that to suggest the state of lovers at the time of separation. In times of farewell, it is said, 'When you leave me, don't forget me. If one day news of me becomes less for you, do not choose another in place of me!'

      <text>O Children of Israel, remember My favor wherewith I favored you;</text>
      <text>The real meaning of 'favor' (niʿma) according to the scholars is an unadulterated pleasure, as well as that which causes [the pleasure]. According to the people of reality favor is what causes you to witness, remember, or brings you to the One who grants the favor, or does not veil you from Him. It can be divided into the favor of mortal beings (abshār) and external things (ẓawāhir), and the favor of spirits (arwāḥ) and innermost hearts (sarāÌir). The first are aspects of comforts and the second are types of witnessings and unveilings.

      <text>The allusion is to the fact that [the servant] combines his belief through exposition (bayān) with his belief through demonstrative proof (burhān). The generality of believers have belief in demonstrative proof based on reasoning (istidlāl), while the elite of the believers have belief through exposition by virtue of being drawn near (iqbāl).

      <text>Seek help in patience and prayer. For it is grievous, except to the humble,</text>
      <text>Patience weans the soul from familiar things and prayer is turning one's attention to obtaining intimate communications. Patience indicates fleeing from any other [than God] and prayer indicates perpetual standing in the presence of the Unseen. Seeking help by the two of them takes a great deal of rigor unless the Real self-discloses to the heart of someone, for in the transmitted tradition [it says], 'Truly when God Most High self-discloses to something, it becomes humble to Him'. When the Real self-discloses He lightens and makes easy what creatures must take on. This is because continual acts of obedience cause burdens which must be endured, whereas the self-disclosure by witnessings through realization brings about the perfection of communion (tamām al-wuṣla) and perpetual nearness (dawām al-zulfa).</text>
      <text>It is said, 'Seek help through Me for patience with Me, and seek help in My preserving for you your prayer for Me so that the incomings (wāridāt) of unveiling and awe will not overwhelm you so much that you will be unable to perform service'. Surely it is a great blessing from the Real when there is a lessening of the onslaughts of ecstatic finding (saṭawāt al-wujūd) upon the heart at the time of unveiling, so that the servant is able to perform the precepts of separation.</text>
      <text>There are several kinds of patience, all of them praiseworthy. There is patience in God, patience for God, patience through God, and patience with God. There is only one type of patience which is not praiseworthy and that is the type of patience which keeps one from God.</text>
      <text>Patience is beautiful</text>

      <text>It is said that the word 'to think' (ẓann) is used here to mean 'certainty' (yaqīn), which would be the most obvious [meaning]. What is meant by it is 'reckoning' (ḥusbān). Those who reckon with the reckoning of certainty (ẓanna ẓann al-yaqīn) are those who experience communion.

      <text>[The phrase] they shall meet their Lord (mulāqū rabbihim) is in a grammatical form appropriate for the past, present and future.

What a difference between those who bear witness to the favor or bounty (fa?l) they receive and those who bear witness to the bounty (fa?l) of their Lord Himself!

      <text>He causes fear in ordinary people by His acts: fear the day and fear the fire [2:24, 3:131]. But He causes fear in the elect by His attributes, for He said, 'And say: "Act, for God will surely see your actions, and [so will] His Messenger"' [9:105], and He said, 'And you are not occupied with any business...but We are witnesses over you when you are engaged therein' [10:61].

      <text>When We divided for you the sea, and We delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh's folk, while you were beholding.</text>
      <text>The perceptive faculties (baṣāÌir) of the Children of Israel had become diminished, so He showed them miracles openly (ʿayānan), whereas the perceptive faculties of this community were sharp, so He unveiled His signs secretly (sirran) to them. This is how His (s) way (sunna) goes. For those who are sharper in the perceptive faculty, the affair will be more subtle for them and the allusions with it more abundant. [The Prophet] (ṣ) said, 'I was given the all-comprehensive words (jawāmiʿ al-kalim) and then the speech (kalām) was shortened for me'.</text>
      <text>When they saw these manifest signs in the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the people of Pharaoh, they were seized with doubt, and said, 'They did not drown even though they were cast into the sea', but the Children of Israel did see them drowning. On the other hand, this community, because of their being foremost in their belief in the Messenger of God (ṣ) and because of the power of their perceptive faculties, [had] one youth [who] said, 'It is as if I was with the people of the Garden exchanging visits, and as if I was with the people of the Fire clamoring to one another, and as if I saw the throne of my Lord in plain sight'.

      <text>What a difference between one community and another! The community of Moses (ʿa) had their prophet withdraw [from them] for forty days and they took the calf as their object of worship and were pleased with that. They said, 'This is your God and the God of Moses: so [Moses] forgot' [20:88]. [On the other hand], the community of Muḥammad the Chosen (ṣ) spent many years with their prophet. If they had heard anyone mention some form of [material] comparison to describe what they worshipped, they would not have spared their last breaths and would have given up their spirits.</text>
      <text>It is said Moses (ṣ) entrusted his community to his brother, saying, 'Take my place with my people' [7:142]. When he returned he found they had fallen into temptation (fitna). Our Prophet (ṣ) relied on God and did not suggest anyone to lead the community. At the end of his life, he was saying 'the highest companions'. See how the Real attended to the care of [Muḥammad's] community in preserving their monotheism.

      <text>The allusion is to the true sense of repentance in abandoning oneself entirely to (khurūj ilā) God.</text>
      <text>[2:54 cont'd] and slay one another;</text>
      <text>Repentance by slaying oneself has not been abrogated, but the Children of Israel's slaying of themselves was overt while this community's repentance by slaying themselves is in killing themselves inwardly, since the first step in seeking God is to abandon (khurūj ʿan) the lower self.</text>
      <text>[Section] Verily the people imagined that the repentance of the Children of Israel was more difficult but it is not as they imagine, for that was the suffering of slaying one time. As for the elect in this community, there is a slaying in every moment. Because of this:</text>
      <text>One who has died and found rest</text>
      <text>is not really dead.</text>
      <text>The only real dead are those</text>
      <text>who are dead among the living.</text>
      <text>Slaying the soul in truth is declaring it free of strength and power, or of bearing witness to anything from it. It is rejecting its claim, confusing its attempts at self-management, submitting all of its affairs to the Real (s), stripping it of its free choice and will, and obliterating the vestiges (athār) of the human from it.

      <text>One who is capable of extracting water from solid rock is capable of quenching thirst without water. But He made the trace or effect (athar) of the miracle manifest in [Moses] and connected the locus (maḥall) of calling for help to him. He had Moses himself engaged in moving the stone, and entrusted him with striking with his staff. This was so that there would be a measure of [human] effort involved in making His decree come to pass in [Moses's] seeking water for his people. Then the Real (s) wanted each people to follow a way, sticking to their boundary, and not disputing with their companions. So He singled out for each tribe a marker by which they would know their drinking-place, so that they would not go each others' drinking-places. When He had met their needs, He bid them to be grateful, to preserve the command, and to stop choosing sin, so He said, 'and do not be degenerate in the earth, seeking corruption'.</text>
      <text>The drinking-places are different and each comes to their own, so one drinking-place is sweet and fresh, another salty and bitter, and another clear and pure, another closed up with only a few drops.

'Go down to a city, you shall have what you demanded'; And abasement, and wretchedness were cast upon them, and they incurred God's wrath; that was because they used to disbelieve the signs of God and slay prophets without right; that was because they disobeyed, and they were transgressors.</text>
      <text>They were not content with the goodness of His choosing for them, nor were they patient in His managing what He was intending for them in basic food and clothing. In their confusion, they fell back to their customary behavior in eating contemptible food and being content with a lower state, so He returned them to the suffering of ignominy (muqāsāt al-hawān) and bound them to perpetual disappointment (idāmat al-khidhlān). They went so far as to shed the blood of prophets and violated the sanctity of the affair with their lack of shame. They did not repent, so He punished them for their ugly acts (qabīh fiʿālihim) and returned them to what He had chosen for their souls in their contemptible states (khasāÌis aḥwālihim). When sincere counsel (naṣīḥa) did not succeed with them, retribution and humiliation (fa?īḥa) overtook them.</text>
      <text>It is said the Children of Israel were divided in their aspirations, scattered in their objectives.

This is the attribute of the people of separation. Patience with the One (al-wāḥid) is hard. God Most High said, 'And when you mention the Lord alone (waḥdahu) in the QurÌān, they turn their backs in aversion' [17:46].</text>

      <text>Surely those who believe, and those of Jewry, and the Christians, and the Sabaeans, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and performs righteous deeds - their wage is with their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve.</text>
      <text>The diversity of [religious] paths in spite of the unity of the source does not prevent a goodly acceptance [for all]. For anyone who affirms the Real (s) in His signs and believes in what He has told concerning His Truth and Attributes, the dissimilarity of [religious] laws and diversity occurring in name[s] is not a problem in considering who merits [God's] good pleasure. Because of that He said, 'Surely those who believe and those of Jewry'. Then He said, 'whoever believes', meaning if they fear [God] in the different ways of knowing [Him], all of them will have a beautiful place of return and an ample reward. The believer (muÌmin) is anyone who is in the protection (amān) of the Real (s). For anyone who is in His protection, it is fitting that no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve.</text>

      <text>And when We made a covenant for you, and We raised above you the Mount, 'Take forcefully what We have given you, and remember what is in it so that you might preserve yourselves'. * Then you turned away thereafter, and but for God's bounty and His mercy towards you, you would have been among the losers.</text>
      <text>He (s) made a covenant with all responsible beings (mukallafūn), but some responded willingly because He made Himself known to them, so they declared His unity. Other people responded unwillingly because He veiled them, so they did not want to recognize Him. There is no proof more powerful than the eye-witnessing of the Mount (ṭūr) He raised above them, which was a mountain (jabal), but they lacked the light of the perceptive faculty (baṣīra) and so the witnessing of physical vision (baṣar) did not benefit them.</text>
      <text>Then you turned away thereafter, i.e. you returned to disobedience after witnessing the signs with your own eyes. If not for His decree in granting respite and His forbearance in acts of grace, He would punish you without delay and cause a great misfortune to descend upon you, and your transaction would be entirely a loss.</text>

      <text>And verily you know that there were those among you who transgressed the Sabbath, and We said to them, 'Be apes, despised!'</text>
      <text>The metamorphosis (maskh) of [Muḥammad's] community occurred in the hearts. When [the Children of Israel] abandoned [God's] command and disdained what was imposed on them from the law, the punishments came quickly in their disgrace, metamorphosis, and the other things which are included in the text. In a similar way, the community [of Muḥammad] was punished because of their violation of the Covenant and rejection of the limit [imposed by God], but [their punishment] was in the metamorphosis of their hearts and the alteration of their states. [God] Most High said, 'And We shall confound their hearts and their eyes; just as they did not believe the first time' [6:110]. The punishments of hearts are far worse than the punishments of the bodily selves. About this they have recited:</text>
      <text>O you who ask me,</text>
      <text>'How have you been after him?'</text>
      <text>I suffered that which tormented me,</text>
      <text>while it made him happy.</text>

      <text>Thus the states of those who were tried by abandonment (muniyā bi'l-hijrān) and branded with disappointment (wusima bi'l-khidhlān) became a lesson - to look at what happened to them is to choke on grief. The one who is reduced to misery after having had status becomes an object of scorn before every low-life. This is what remains for those who have been brought low after the wrath of kings and the shunning of chieftains:</text>

      <text>And when Moses said to his people, 'God commands you to sacrifice a cow'...</text>
      <text>It was obligatory for them to meet the command head on, but they wasted time with external appearances, imagining that they had the leisure to linger in their digression from the covenant obligation. So the misery was doubled for them and the ignominy they had been warned about overtook them.</text>
      <text>[Section] When He said: '...She is a cow neither old, nor virgin, middling between the two...' [2:68], it meant she would be neither young nor aged but somewhere between the two. The allusion is to the fact that one who is suited for this path (ṭarīqa) is one who is neither attracted by the impetuosity of youth and its drunkenness, nor paralyzed by the weakness and frailty of old age. Rather he is alert, having regained consciousness from his drunkenness yet retaining some of the vigor of his youth.</text>

      <text>Just as her [bright] color would have been perceived by the eyes, the allusion here is to those of the People of the Story (ahl al-qiṣṣa) whose witnessing overwhelms the hearts [of others] because of that which is clothed with the garment of invincibility (jabarūt) and made to rise from the witness of the Unseen. One notices such a one has become oblivious to human states and has been taken over by the remembrance of the Real. Thus, in the transmitted tradition: The saints of God are those who, when they are seen, God is remembered.</text>

      <text>He said, 'He says she shall be a cow not broken to plough the earth, or to water the tillage, with no blemish on her'. They said, 'Now you have brought the truth'; and so they sacrificed her, even though they very nearly did not.</text>
      <text>Just as this cow was not to have been broken in for work, nor worn out for the purposes of profits, there was to be no color in her inconsistent with the overall grandeur of her color. The allusion in it is to the people of divine friendship (walāya) who have not exerted themselves with others in order to obtain what they seek through causes, and who have not relied in their hearts on external appearances and simulacra. They have not trusted in their own choosing and contrivance. They are not prey to the claims of desire, nor game in the claws of the present world. Carnal desires do not rule them and no human authority controls them. They have not striven at all to obtain what they desire and are not concerned with attaining what they wish for. There is no mark of others upon them, nor any sign of causes, for they are supported by God, annihilated from all else, nay, effaced as God turns them this way and that. God has conquered their hearts. Just as their object of worship is God, so their only aim is God. Just as their aim is God, so what they bear witness to is God and what they have found is God. Nay, they are effaced in God and [only] God remains after them. The one who spoke for them recited:</text>
      <text>If you want me to be pleased</text>
      <text>and you to be pleased</text>
      <text>and to take the reins</text>

      <text>and speak with my tongue.</text>
      <text>[2:71 cont'd] They said, 'Now you have brought the truth'; and so they sacrificed her, even though they very nearly did not.</text>
      <text>They sought a stratagem for themselves, but when their stratagems failed, they submitted to the decree and were rid of the difficulties of the demands. If they had done what they were commanded to do [straight away], the misery would not have been doubled for them.</text>

      <text>Allah (s) wanted to give life to the dead man so that he could expose his killer through the testimony [of the slain], so He commanded them to kill one of their animals, making it the cause of bringing the slain man to life. The allusion in it is that anyone who desires the life of his heart will only attain it by sacrificing his lower self, since the heart of anyone who sacrifices his lower self by difficult efforts (mujāhadāt) comes to life by the lights of witnessing (mushāhadāt). Likewise, when God wants someone's reputation to live forever, He causes his reputation in this world to pass into obscurity.</text>

      <text>He explained that even though they witnessed weighty signs and had seen clear proofs, when [divine] solicitude did not help them and God did not create guidance for them, the many signs only increased their hardness and brought misery upon misery for them from the hiding places of the [divine] preordination. He compared their hearts to stones because [stones] do not grow or thrive, and their hearts likewise do not understand and are not aware. Then He explained that [their hearts] are even harder than stones, for there are stones from which rivers come gushing and upon which the traces of the fear of God appear. But their hearts are empty of all good. How can it not be so when [their hearts] were made to suffer the turning of the Real from them (muniyat bi-iʿrā?i'l-ḥaqq minhā) and were singled out for the removal of all good from them (khuṣṣat bi-intizāʿi'l-khayrāt minhā).</text>

How can those who do not remain in a state of faith after eye-witnessing (ʿiyān) believe by means of demonstrative proof (burhān)?

      <text>He related that they were different in the shortcomings of their disbelief. One group is the most contemptible, while the majority relied on blind following (taqlīd) out of ignorance. It was not that doubt seized them but rather they were misled by conjecture and guessing. They have no share in their Scriptures except reciting them without knowledge of their meanings.

Their conjecturing has gotten the better of them, for they judge themselves, out of extreme foolishness, to be among the People of the Story. Such a one abides (yakhlud) with the murmurings of his lower desires.

      <text>...and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, i.e., 'just as you protect their rights by ransoming them, so must you restrain your hands from them and forswear expelling them from their homelands.

Through this you will rescue him from doubt and questioning, and take him out of the darknesses of blind imitation (taqlīd). The redemption of the captive you find shackled to his random thoughts and enslaved by the clamor of his lower self is that you direct him to the witnessing of favors.

      <text>And you shall find them the people most covetous of life, and the idolaters; any one of them would love that he might be given life for a thousand years; yet, his being given life shall not budge him from the chastisement. God sees what they do.</text>
      <text>Love of life in this world is the result of heedlessness of God. The worst heedlessness is their excessive love for remaining in this world. The state of the believer is the opposite of this. The eagerness for life of those who are heedless and insolent is only because they know their failure in being obedient. The runaway slave does not want to be returned to his master. But for believers, the transition [of death] to One from Whom only good is expected is better than remaining with those against whose evil they are not secure. The prolonging of life in spite of the certainty of death holds no value for them since [death] comes unexpectedly and life is cut off. What is coming is near. When the life span is completed, there is no averting the assaults of the appointed time upon the shoulders of hope (lā maradda li-hujūmi'l-ajal ʿalā aktāfi'l-amal).</text>

      <text>Say: 'Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - he it was that brought it down upon your heart by the leave of God, confirming what was before it, a guidance, and good tidings for the believers. * Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael - then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers'.</text>
      <text>The Jews claimed that Gabriel did not come with good, that they did not love him, and that if it had been Michael, they would have believed in him. The Real (s) showed them to be liars when He said, 'Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel [thinking] he did not bring good, what good is greater than the QurÌān that descended through him?'</text>
      <text>Then He said that whoever is an enemy to Gabriel and Michael, God is his enemy. Surely the messenger of the Beloved to the highly esteemed beloved [Muḥammad] has a noble status and weighty rank. The enmity of the disbelievers does not harm Gabriel - the Real (swt) is his protector (walī). Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel, God is his enemy. How mighty and glorified is this status!

      <text>And they follow what the devils used to relate Solomon's kingdom: Solomon disbelieved not, but the devils disbelieved, teaching the people sorcery; and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babylon - Hārūt and Mārūt. They taught not any man, without them saying, 'We are but a temptation; do not disbelieve'. From them they learned how they might cause division between a man and his wife, yet they did not hurt any man thereby save by the leave of God; and they learned what hurt them, and did not profit them. And surely they knew well that whoever buys it, he shall have no share in the Hereafter;</text>
      <text>Whoever is divided by his whims falls into one state of heedlessness after another, so that every kind of ignorant affair welcomes him. Moreover, those whose absence is prolonged become a warning to others and a temptation for whoever follows their path. Whoever emulates them in their transgression joins their community and becomes one of them. This is the case in the description of Hārūt and Mārūt and what happened to them - they became a temptation and a warning for men. Their tribulation will be extended to whoever listens to what they say and does not take into account their ignorance. They will also share in the distress that afflicts them in the Hereafter.</text>
      <text>The allusion in their story is to the one on this path (ṭarīqa) who is inclined to affectation, deception and putting forth counterfeit claims. He attracts followers whom he throws into Hell by his falsehood. He blocks them by the sparks of fire of his ignorance from the path of right direction. Whoever takes heed crosses over to safety by its bridges (qanāṭīrihi). Whoever becomes disgraced by his inclination to falsehoods (abāṭīlihi), torn are his veils (astāruhu) and exposed to anyone with eyes is his fault (ʿawāruhu). When Hārūt and Mārūt were deceived by the disobedience to which they had become accustomed, they blamed the disobedience of the children of Adam. Because of the tendencies toward carnal desires that became part of them, and the promptings to temptations and harmful things, they plunged forward into disobedience. What happened to them is what the storytellers relate: they are hanging upside down until the Day of the Resurrection and if not for [God's] gentleness (rifq) towards them and their affair, their punishment would not end then.</text>

      <text>And whatever verse We abrogate or postpone, We bring [in place] a better, or the like of it; do you not know that God has power over all things?</text>
      <text>Abrogation (naskh) is the removal of something, i.e., what moves you from one state to that which is above and superior to it, for the branch of your communion is forever flourishing and the star of your majesty is forever shining. 'We do not abrogate anything of the traces of worship (ʿibāda) without substituting for it something from the lights of servanthood (ʿubūdiyya). And We do not abrogate anything from the lights of servanthood without putting something in its place from the moons of servitude (ʿubūda).

      <text>Many of the People of the Scripture long that they might make you disbelievers, after you have believed, from the envy of their own souls, after the truth has become clear to them; yet pardon and be forgiving till God brings His command; truly God has power over all things.</text>
      <text>Those who have lost understanding among the heedless wish that not even a star would rise over those who are in peace and safety (salāma), and those who are possessed by envy would like the sun to stop shining over those whom they envy. This is what the attributes of disbelievers are like, so God abases and humbles them.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this is to the state of those who possess spiritual desire (irāda) in the beginning, when they embark on their travels. If they are not helped by success granted in companionship and they live among people following externals, these people will prevent them from travelling and will not stop in their advice to them. They will frighten them with weakness and threaten them with poverty until they divert them to the way of heedlessness and cut them off from the path of spiritual desire. These are the enemies of God in truth who have been overtaken by the enmity of the moment. Their punishment is being deprived of smelling any of the fragrances of sincerity (ṣidq).</text>
      <text>Yet pardon and be forgiving..., for the way of the aspirant is to protect his innermost self from anyone or anything other [than God].

      <text>The allusion in it is that the one who does evil is one who ruins the homelands (awṭān) of worship by carnal passions - and the homelands of worship are the selves of the worshippers (nufūs al-ʿābidīn).

      <text>The allusion in it is to the eastern and western places of hearts. The hearts have rising lights (shawāriq) and night visitors (ṭawāriq). The night visitors are the murmurings (hawājis) of the lower selves that arrive in the darknesses of desire and carnal passions. The rising lights are the stars of different types of knowledge, the moons of presence and the suns of gnosis.</text>
      <text>As long as the lights are rising the qibla of hearts is clear and visible. Then when the realities take over, the authority of the lights become hidden like stars at the rising of the sun. Similarly at the appearance of the Real there is destruction and subjugation, so there is no witnessing of any trace, no remaining sensation or comprehension, no power of intellect or knowledge, no illumination of mystical knowledge. For the experiencing of all these qualities lasts only as long as human nature lasts. When those who have attributes become effaced, how can any attribute of theirs remain?</text>
      <text>He said, 'whithersoever you turn, there is the Face of God'. As long as there is a remnant or even a sliver of sensory perception and ability to differentiate, then the qibla should be aimed for, and if it is not known, it should be sought. According to scholars, when the guideposts in every direction are obscure and there is no knowledge of the qibla, all directions are equally permissible for prayer since none of them can be preferred for the intention (niyya).</text>

The Real (s) tested His friend (khalīl) (ʿa) by what He imposed upon him and prescribed for him, and [Abraham] upheld the necessary conditions and fulfilled the requirements decreed. So He (s) praised him, saying, 'And Abraham, who fulfilled (waffā)' (53:37), [which is] from tawfiya, i.e., he did not fall short in any way whatsoever.</text>
      <text>It is said He imposed the burdens of prophecy on him and sought from him the properties of friendship (khulla). The most intense trial for him was upholding the conditions of friendship and being singled out for avoidance of everyone and everything. He performed what made that sound, withdrawing from everything other than Him secretly and publicly. Because of that, he paid no attention to Gabriel (ʿa) when he appeared to him as he was being thrown into the depths of destruction. [Gabriel] said, 'Do you need anything?' He said, 'From you? No'. It was part of the perfection of his trial that Gabriel (ʿa) appeared to him in this state. What would there have been left of him that would leave a place for any created being, whoever that might have been?</text>
      <text>In this there is a subtle allusion to the difference between the state of our Prophet (ṣ) and the state of Abraham (ʿa) because Gabriel appeared to the friend and showed himself to him and [Abraham] said, 'From you? No'. But Gabriel was not capable of companionship with the Prophet (ṣ) and thus expressed his weakness, saying 'If I were to come closer so much as a fingertip, I would be consumed by fire'.

[On the other hand], when he spoke about leadership, saying 'And of my seed?' [2:125] without [divine] permission, [the request] was denied and it was said to him, 'My covenant shall not reach the evildoers' [2:125].</text>

      <text>Because the obligations were received from messengers and were not merely something intellectually perceived, [Abraham] asked that they not be left to themselves, without a messenger or law. He requested that the messenger be one of them so that they would feel more at home with him and it would be easier for them. Its meaning, rightly understood, is that when He (s) informed [Abraham] of the state of our Prophet (ṣ), [Abraham] asked for the completion of what He had promised by way of the one He commanded.</text>

      <text>When his Lord said to him, 'Submit', he said, 'I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds'.</text>
      <text>Islām is sincerity (ikhlāṣ) and submission (istislām). Its true meaning is withdrawing entirely from the states of mortal humanity (bashariyya) with respect to the struggles over free choice (ikhtiyār) and the oppositional tendencies of the lower self (muʿāra?āt al-nafs). [Abraham] said, 'I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds: I have accepted the command (amr), hearing and obeying, and I have embraced the decree (ḥukm) as much as I am able'. He did not hold back any of his wealth, body or progeny. When he was commanded to sacrifice his son, he intended to do it. When He said to him, 'Release him from his bond', he did what he was commanded to do. There was no free choice in either of the states for him and no self-directing (tadbīr).</text>
      <text>It is said his saying, 'I have submitted (aslamtu)' was surely not by way of any claim for himself because the true meaning of islām is rather to absolve oneself of strength and power. So when He said, 'I have submitted', it was as if he said, 'Raise me up in what you have charged me and carry out from me that to which you have commanded me'. He turned the affair over to Him without proclaiming any meaning or warrant from himself.</text>
      <text>It is said He bid him to take on the demands of the divine power of deliberation (muṭālabāt al-qudra), for surely one who takes up his abode in friendship, what dwells in him is what dwells in the other (fa-inna man ḥalla fī'l-khullati maḥallahu yaḥullu bihi lā maḥāla mā ḥalla bihi).</text>
      <text>One might ask a question here: How could Abraham (ṣa) have said, 'I have submitted', when it was said to our Prophet (ṣ), 'Know', but he did not say, 'I have come to know?' The answer for that has several aspects, one of which is that the Prophet (ṣ) said, 'I am the most knowledgeable of you about God' but since a law did not come after him it used to be said about him that he said, 'I have come to know' (ʿalimtu).</text>
      <text>It is said God (s) spoke about the Messenger (ʿa) in His saying, 'The Messenger believes' [2:285], because belief is knowledge of God (swt).</text>

      <text>And Abraham enjoined upon his sons this, and [so did] Jacob, 'My sons, God has chosen for you the [true] religion, see that you die not save in submission.</text>
      <text>He related that Abraham (ʿa) enjoined his sons, as did Jacob (ʿa), saying 'Do not let death come upon you except in the state of submission (islām)'. Their laws, even if they differed in acts, were of one origin. The drinking place of declaring oneness (tawḥīd) is not divided into two. God Most High's words: God has chosen for you the [true] religion was good news in strengthening their desire, in their supplications, for what He had charged them with in submitting (islām), because when they realized that God (s) had chosen them for that, they knew that without doubt He would help them and make it easy for them to perform the just claim of submission (islām).</text>

Thus He said, 'And I shall shun you and that which you call upon besides God' [19:48].

      <text>The midmost is the best and He appointed this community the best of communities. He appointed this group (ṭāÌifa) the best of this community for they are the best of the best. Just as this community will be witnesses over the communities at the Resurrection, so this group are the foundational roots (uṣūl) around which [the community] turns: they are the pole (quṭb) and through them God protects the entire community. Whomever their hearts accept is accepted and whomever their hearts reject is rejected - the judgment (ḥukm) is theirs. Their discernment (firāsa) is sincere and true (ṣādiq), their judgment (ḥukm) is sound (ṣaḥīḥ) and their consideration (naẓar) is correct (ṣāÌib), a protection for the entire community from agreeing in error. The protection of this group from error is in [their] consideration and judgment, [their] acceptance and rejection. Moreover, the building of their affair rests upon the way (sunna) of the Messenger (ṣ). Anything which is not an emulation of the Messenger (ʿa) is a rejection of him and its follower has nothing.</text>
      <text>[2:143 cont'd] We did not appoint the direction you were facing, except that We might know, who followed the Messenger from him who turned on his heels - though it were a grave thing, save for those whom God has guided; but God would never cause your faith to be wasted; truly, God is Gentle with people, Merciful.</text>
      <text>He explained that the decree in determining the matter of the qibla up to the time of the change, and then at the time of the substitution, was a test for them from the Real in order to distinguish the sincere (ṣādiq) from the one who reneges (māriq). To those who viewed the matter with the eye of separation (tafriqa), the change was intolerable. To those who looked with the eye of reality (ḥaqīqa), the true sense appeared to their inner sight. Then He said: but God would never cause your faith to be wasted, i.e., for those who are with God in all states with one heart, the differences in their states are one, whether He causes change or stillness, makes firm or shifts, confirms or changes - they are through Him for Him in all states.

      <text>From whatever place you issue, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it, so that there be not any argument from the people against you; excepting the evildoers among them;</text>
      <text>'If you want there to be no pathway for anyone against you, no shadow to fall upon you from any created thing, and no hand to reach you with evil, then from whatever place you issue (ḥaythumā kunta), whithersoever you are (aynamā kunta), and whatever state you are in (kayfamā kunta), be for Us (kun lanā) and be from Us (wa kun minnā), for truly whoever occupies themselves exclusively with Us - nothing can get to them'.</text>

      <text>The perfection of grace is to add unveiling (kashf) to kindness (luṭf). The one whom He suffices through the exigency of His generosity (jūd) is below the one whom He enriches by the rightful due (ḥaqq) of His existence (wujūd). Concerning the meaning of this, they have recited:</text>

      <text>The [only] imperfection of what we are in,</text>

      <text>As also We have sent among you, of yourselves, a messenger, to recite Our verses to you and to purify you, and to teach you the Book, and wisdom, and to teach you what you knew not.</text>
      <text>The sending of the Messenger was to open the gates of attainment, for it was in His (s) prior knowledge that the hearts of His friends would be thirsty to meet Him. There is no way for anyone to Him except through the intermediary of the messengers. Through sending messengers He charged some people with the burdens [of prescriptive law] (kulaf) and by the sending of messengers to others, He honored them with the arts of drawing near and approaching (zulaf).

      <text>So remember Me, I will remember you; and be thankful to Me, and be not ungrateful towards Me.</text>
      <text>Remembrance is the immersion of the one who is remembering in the witnessing (shuhūd) of that which is remembered, and then it is being consumed in the existence (wujūd) of that which is being remembered until no trace (athar) remains of you doing the remembering, so that it is said 'so and so' once was.</text>
      <text>So remember me, I will remember you, i.e., 'be consumed in Our existence (wujūd) and We will remember you after your annihilation from yourself'. God Most High said, 'For indeed formerly they had been virtuous' [51:16]. They were here for a time but they have become perpetually separate (bānū dāÌiman):</text>
      <text>The world is</text>
      <text>a beautiful [passing] event,</text>
      <text>so be a beautiful event</text>
      <text>for the one who is aware.</text>
      <text>The path of the people of literal expression (ʿibāra) is 'So remember me by acts of conformity (muwāfaqāt) [to the divine command], I will remember you with special gifts (karamāt)'. The path of the people of people of allusion (ishāra) is 'So remember me in abandoning every worldly concern (ḥaẓẓ), I will remember you by raising you up in My reality (ḥaqq) after your annihilation from yourselves'.</text>
      <text>'So remember me being content with Me instead of My gifts and favors (af?āl), I will remember you by being pleased with you regardless of your actions (afʿāl)'.</text>
      <text>'So remember me - and it is by My remembrance of you that you remember, for without My prior remembrance your remembrance would not occur'.</text>
      <text>'So remember me by cutting off attachments (ʿalāÌiq), I will remember you by the attributes of realities (ḥaqāÌiq)'.</text>
      <text>It is said 'remember Me belongs to everyone you meet, I will remember you belongs to those I address'. Whoever remembers Me in a congregation, I will remember him in a congregation better than theirs.</text>
      <text>It is said 'and be thankful to Me for the tremendous blessing to you in that I said to you: So remember me, I will remember you'.</text>
      <text>It is said gratitude is a kind of remembrance. In His words, 'and be not ungrateful, the prohibition against ingratitude (kufrān) is a command to be grateful. Gratitude is a remembrance so He repeated for you the command to remember'.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, seek help through patience and prayer; surely God is with the patient.</text>
      <text>'Seek help through patience for the blessing (ṣalāt)'. That is to say, 'your being worthy of your Lord's blessing (ṣalāt) is by your patience at the flow of the decrees of the Real over you'. For that reason God Most High said: yet give good tidings to the patient [2:155] followed by: Upon those rest blessings (ṣalawāt) and mercy from their Lord [2:157].</text>
      <text>It is said that the patient are entitled to the ultimate treasures and the highest ranks inasmuch as they have attained the company (maʿiyya) of God Most High Who said 'Surely God is with (maʿa) the patient'.</text>

      <text>And say not of those slain in God's way: 'They are dead'; rather they are living; but you are not aware.</text>
      <text>Life passed away from them in this world but they arrived at eternal life in the end. They are, in truth, living, finding all kinds of special gifts (karamāt) from God.</text>
      <text>It is said they are living because God is the One Who takes over (khalaf) after them and anyone for whom God is the substitute is not dead. The one who spoke for them said about one who was created:</text>
      <text>Verily through you ʿItāb has departed</text>
      <text>for the sake of His way,</text>
      <text>but he who remains belongs to Him.</text>
      <text>Like Khālid, he has not died.</text>
      <text>It is said they are living by God's remembrance of them. By the beauty of His eternal remembrance, one who is the object of the Real's remembrance is not dead.</text>
      <text>It is said verily their corporeal forms (ashbāḥ) are dispersed (mutafarriqa), but their spirits (arwāḥ) are proven true (mutaḥaqqiqa) through the Real (s). If their corporeal forms have been annihilated through God, their spirits have remained through God, for whoever is annihilated through God, his remaining is through God.</text>
      <text>It is said they are living in the testimonial witnessings of exaltation, the cloak of awe upon them. They are in the shade of intimacy, delighted by His beauty in one moment and overwhelmed by His majesty in the next.</text>

      <text>Surely We will try you with something of fear and hunger, and diminution of goods and lives and fruits; yet give good tidings to the patient; * those who, when they are struck by an affliction, say, 'Surely we belong to God, and to Him we will return'.</text>
      <text>He tried them by blessing in order to make their gratitude manifest and He tried them by tribulation in order to make their patience manifest. He caused that which was [already] known of their state to enter into existence, marked them with the record that He had decreed, and established them with the attribute He [already] knew. He tried them with fear within which there was a clearing of their breasts, and by hunger within which there was a cleansing of their bodies, and by diminution of goods within which was a purification of their material blessings (niʿma). Through the afflictions suffered by the lower selves, their wages were magnified before God, and through the blight of fruits, their recompense was doubled from God.</text>
      <text>Yet give good tidings to the patient meaning those who do not oppose His decree in what He brings to pass.</text>
      <text>It is said He asked fear of them in their seeking to avoid His punishment; then the suffering of hunger in their desiring His nearness and generosity; then the diminution of goods by giving alms and renouncing [the goods] in their looking to what is better than [goods] in obtaining knowledge of Him; and lives (anfus), in their submitting them to worship of Him; and fruits, in their supporting the abandonment of that which they hope for in abundant material blessings. Yet give good tidings to those who are patient in seeking the beautiful in His decree and yielding to the flow of His power.</text>
      <text>The demands of the Unseen will either be through wealth, the self, or near relations. Whoever devotes wealth to God will have salvation (najāt). Whoever exerts the self for His decree will have degrees (darajāt). Whoever is patient with the misfortunes of near relations will have recompense and stations of nearness (qurubāt). Whoever does not hoard the spirit from Him will have perpetual intimate communications (muwāṣalāt).</text>
      <text>Those who, when they are struck by an affliction face the matter with patience and even gratitude. Nay, [they are] even exultant, boastful.</text>

      <text>They attained their patience and their ability to withstand the demands of the divine decree by His prior blessings to them. It was not because of their patience or their endurance that they arrived at His blessings, for if not for His pre-eternal mercy, their obedience would not have arisen through the condition of servitude, for His prior solicitude is what brought pure guidance to them.</text>
      <text>They are the truly guided: Because He blessed them in the beginning, they were guided in the end.</text>

      <text>Truly Ṣafā and Marwa are among the waymarks of God,</text>
      <text>These sites and remains, these ruins and markings, are extolled and visited. One sets out for them because they are the ruins of the lovers where the vestiges [still] gleam:</text>
      <text>The passions of houses belongs</text>
      <text>to those who have lived in them.</text>
      <text>There is no concern or joy</text>
      <text>in the house itself.</text>
      <text>Truly the earth of their path, even the dust of their footprints, has tremendous value for the lovers. Even the smallest bit of dust that falls upon the edges of their path is more precious than the most fragrant musk:</text>
      <text>And that is only because</text>
      <text>Umayma walked beside it</text>
      <text>in a group [of women],</text>
      <text>trailing a garment.</text>
      <text>[2:158] so whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House, or the Visitation, he would not be at fault, if he circumambulates them; and whoever volunteers good, God is Grateful, Knowing.</text>
      <text>Ṣafā and Marwa were favored in being close to the House. The running between the two became part of the law, just as the circumambulation became part of the law for the House. Just as the circumambulation is one of the main rites of the pilgrimage, so is the running. The neighbor is honored for the sake of the neighbor.</text>

      <text>The allusion in this verse is to those to whom the Real (s) has unveiled knowledge of the good manners of travelling and who have become stingy in revealing [this knowledge] to aspirants for the purposes of advice and guidance. In that moment they become loathsome. What is to be feared for them is that the blessing will be removed from their knowledge when they fall short in it, just as when they hold back in imparting it to the deserving.</text>

      <text>They compensate for their past negligence with a gracious turning back, take on the task of giving advice to the aspirants, and show clearly to them, with a beautiful way of showing and furnishing proof, the goodness of upholding certain modes of behavior. Surely the clearest proof of the clarity of your actions, and the truest testimony of that by which you call people to God, is that your behavior does not contradict what you have alluded to in your speech.

      <text>The allusion in it is to those to who, after they have travelled the path of spiritual desire (irāda), find it fitting to return to the states of the people of habit (ahl al-ʿāda). Then they are in the grip of this estrangement [from the path] and in this condition leave the world. Those are the companions of separation. There is no drawing near for their spirits or setting straight their calamity, no asking for mercy from anyone. They have lost in this world and the Hereafter.

      <text>Your God is One God; there is no god except Him, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</text>
      <text>He honoured them with the greatest honour in saying: Your God. The shaykhs of this group said: The sign of the one whom He has prepared for the elect of the elect is that He says to him, 'My servant' - and this is more perfect than that. His saying, 'Your God', connecting His reality to you, is better than His connecting you to Himself. This is because His divinity for you is without defect, while your existence for Him is as a servant, with only each defect and harm of yours to give in exchange. When did He say to you 'Your God'? Was it at the time of your obedience, your movements and states of rest, your essence or qualities? Nay, it was before that in the eternity of eternity, time without time or season, trace or event.</text>
      <text>The One Who:</text>
      <text>there is nothing similar that comes close to Him,</text>
      <text>there is no resemblance that approaches Him,</text>
      <text>there is no partner who is related to Him,</text>
      <text>there is no companion who is on intimate terms with Him,</text>
      <text>there is no associate who works hand in hand with Him,</text>
      <text>there is no helper who assists Him,</text>
      <text>and there is no combatant who opposes Him.</text>
      <text>[It is] the oneness of the Real, the eternalness of the Source, the perpetuity of the Abiding, the endlessness of Might and the sempiternity of the Essence.</text>
      <text>One in the might of His radiance, singular in the majesty of His splendor, alone in the omnipotence of His grandeur, eternal in the authority of His might, glorious in the beauty of His sovereignty. Whoever tries to speak at length describing Him becomes incapable of expression. If it were not for the fact that He is the Compassionate, the Merciful, then the servant would be destroyed when exposed to knowledge of Him, at the first glimmer of the appearances of His might.</text>

      <text>He informed the hearts of the seekers among the rational thinkers (aṣḥāb al-istidlāl) and those who possess intellects (arbāb al-ʿuqūl) of the evidentiary proofs of His deliberative power, the signs of His existence, and the marks of His lordship, which are His different kinds of acts. He drew their attention to the different aspects of wisdom and evidentiary proofs of [divine] oneness (waḥdāniyya), within which He established demonstrative proofs that are subtle in expression and aspects of the evidentiary proofs that are precise in allusion. For there is no entity arising out of nonexistence, whether a person or ruins, trace or vestige, heaven or space, air or water, sun or moon, drop or rain, sand or stone, star or tree, that is not evidence of oneness (waḥdāniyya) and a means of access for those who direct themselves to His existence.</text>

      <text>Yet there be people who take to themselves compeers besides God, loving them as God is loved;</text>
      <text>These are people whom the Real (s) did not appoint as the people of love (ahl al-maḥabba). He kept them occupied with the love of other things so that they were satisfied with loving everything that their lower selves desired. They were satisfied with something made for them to worship, and something other than Him carved for them to love.</text>
      <text>[2:165 cont'd] but those who believe love God more ardently; If he were to see those who did evil, when they see the chastisement, that the might altogether belongs to God, and that God is terrible in chastisement.</text>
      <text>What is intended here is not to recall the idol worshippers' love for other things, but rather to praise the believers for their love. The need is not for you to increase your love so as to surpass the love of disbelievers for their idols. Rather the lover wants to remember his beloved as much as he can and finds everything that comes from the beloved beautiful.</text>
      <text>It is said the reason for the superiority of the love of believers for God over the love of the disbelievers for their idols is that the latter love is from like to like, and it is expected that like will incline to like. But [the love of believers for God] is a love of One who is not like them, and that is more precious and more worthy.</text>
      <text>It is said that [the disbelievers] love what they can see and there is nothing amazing about loving that which has been seen with one's own eyes. But the believers love the One who has comes in between them and their seeing, a cloak of grandeur on their faces.</text>
      <text>It is said those who believe love God more ardently because they do not dissociate themselves from God even if He punishes them. The disbeliever dissociates himself from the idol and the idol from the disbeliever, just as God Most High said, 'When those who were followed disown their followers' [2:166].</text>
      <text>It is said the love (maḥabba) of the believers comes from the love of God for them, for that is more perfect. God Most High said, 'whom He loves and who love Him' [5:54], while their love for idols is a matter of whim (hawā).</text>

As for the believers, they will have their lives, possessions, spouses and children taken from them [but their sincerity will remain]. [The disbelievers] will be made to reside in the graves for a few years and then He will try them at the Resurrection through lengthy terrors and the questioning of actions (ṭul al-ahwāl wa'l-suÌāl), and then cast them in the fire. [But] He will grant lengthy days and lives (ṭul al-ayām wa'l-aʿmār) to [the believers] so they will continue to increase in their love for Him.

      <text>It is not piety, that you turn your faces to the East and to the West. True piety is [that of] the one who believes in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the prophets, and who gives of his substance, however cherished to kinsmen and orphans and the needy and the traveller and beggars, and for slaves, and who observes prayer and pays the alms, and those who fulfill their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant, those who endure with fortitude misfortune, hardship, and peril are the ones who are truthful, and these are the ones who are fearful.</text>
      <text>The allusion is that external circumstances [such as which way one turns for the qibla] are not that important whereas information about God is precious. The copious recitation of litanies, even if they are exalted, is the business of old and weak people. Devotional acts of obedience, even if they are powerful, are what ordinary people do. Spending night and day in an abundance of tasks and exertions has great weight in becoming worthy of the reward, but knowledge of the Real is rare and precious.</text>
      <text>What is mentioned in this verse about different kinds of beautiful acts (iḥsān) and aspects of issues of faith (imān): the giving of wealth, the purification of works, the connection to kin, holding to different types of protective arrangements and obligations, the fulfillment of contracts, and observing the limits, are of momentous effect and great significance, beloved to the Real as a law and what He seeks as a command. But the standing in of the Real as a substitute for you after your annihilation, and your being effaced from yourself as a witness (shāhid), your being consumed in the existence of eternity, the suspension of the external markings (rusūm) from the familiar things (musākanāt) of your sensory awareness (iḥsās) is more perfect and higher in meaning because in unity (tawḥīd) no trace or vestige remains, and no other or remnant are left behind.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, prescribed for you is retaliation, regarding the slain; a free man, for a free man, and a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if anything is pardoned any one in relation to his brother, let the pursuing be honorable. And let the payment to him be with kindliness; that is an alleviation given by your Lord, and a mercy; and for him who commits aggression after that - his is a painful chastisement.</text>
      <text>The right of retaliation is prescribed in the law but forgiveness is better, so he who inclines to receiving his right in full is one who submits (muslim), while he who renounces seeking his right is one who acts in a beautiful way (muḥsin). The first is a possessor of worship and even servanthood. The second is the possessor of nobleheartedness (futuwwa) and even freedom.</text>
      <text>Retaliation according to the people of knowledge (ahl al-ʿilm) entails bloodshed. According to the allusion of the people of the story (ahl al-qiṣṣa), their blood goes unavenged and their lives are good for nothing. He said:</text>
      <text>The heart you caused to tremble</text>
      <text>gives praise to you,</text>
      <text>and the blood you made spill is proud</text>
      <text>to have been spilled by you.</text>
      <text>The blood of the lovers shed over the carpet of nearness is the perfume of the people of communion. The Prophet (ṣ) said: The color is the color of blood and the smell is the smell of musk.</text>

      <text>In retaliation there is life for you, O people of pith, so that you might fear.</text>
      <text>In carrying out the retaliation there is life because when one knows that if he kills, he will himself be killed, he refrains from killing. In that there is life for the one who kills and the one who is killed.</text>
      <text>But in abandoning retaliation, according to the allusive explanation, there is greater life because when one has been annihilated in Him (s), He is the successor for him and his life from Him is more perfect for him than his remaining with himself. When God has inherited from them and succeeded them, the remaining of the Successor is dearer than the life of the one who was annihilated.</text>

      <text>Prescribed for you, when any of you is approached by death and leaves behind some good, is to make testament in favor of his parents and kinsmen honorably - an obligation on those that fear.</text>
      <text>The testament regarding one's wealth is recommended for anyone who has wealth to leave behind. But if one leaves nothing behind, what is the use of a testament? The circumstance of the wealthy is such that they bequeath by thirds at the end of their lives. The friends depart from their living entirely and therefore leave nothing but an aspiration (himma), which is separated from them and not connected to anything. Because there is no way for the aspiration to the Real and no attachment to any created thing, [the aspiration] remains alone, separate and disconnected. They have recited:</text>
      <text>As long as I am living I will love you</text>
      <text>and when I die</text>
      <text>my decaying bones</text>
      <text>will keep loving you in the ground.</text>
      <text>This is their testament. One of them said:</text>
      <text>...</text>
      <text>And it is even as another of them said:</text>
      <text>The traces tell that</text>
      <text>they left not long ago.</text>
      <text>They returned to their lands</text>
      <text>and my tears flowed for them.</text>

      <text>But if any one fears injustice or sin from one making testament, and so makes things right between them, then no sin shall be upon him; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.</text>
      <text>The allusion in it is to the one who recognizes a weakness in one of the aspirants (murīdūn), or sees in one of the novices (ahl al-bidāya) a laxity of purpose (qaṣd). Or he finds someone giving counsel, speaking with pure sincerity, to someone who does not have the capacity for it. His view is that he is being kind to the aspirant by being indulgent, encouraging, coaxing and permissive towards him. This is not objectionable, for urging people to pure sincerity [on the path] in what is not yet firmly established in them has an ample reward. Showing kindness to novices when they are not yet firm in their resolve or sincere in their effort is a crucial element in seeking to make things right.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, prescribed for you is the Fast, just as it was prescribed for those that were before you so that you might guard yourselves.</text>
      <text>Fasting is of two types: the external fast which is abstention from things that break the fast accompanied by the intention [to fast], and the inner fast which is preserving the heart from harm, then the preservation of the spirit from familiar comforts (musākanāt), and then the preservation of the inner self from considerations (malāḥaẓāt).</text>
      <text>It is said the requirement of the fasting of worshippers, if it is to be complete, is preserving the tongue from slander (ghība), and preserving the glance from viewing with suspicion (rība), as it is said in the tradition, 'Whoever fasts, let him fast with his ears, his eyes...'. As for the fast of those who know, it is protecting the innermost self from witnessing anything other than Him.</text>
      <text>For those who abstain from the things that break the fast, the end of their fast is when night falls. For those who fast from everything other [than Him], the end of their fast is that they witnesses the Real. He (ṣ) said, 'Fast to see Him and break your fast to see Him'. [In this ḥadīth the letter] hāÌ in his words (ṣ) li-ruÌyatihi refers, according to the people of realization (ahl al-taḥqīq), to the Real (s). The religious scholars (ʿulamāÌ) say its meaning is 'Fast when you see the new moon of Rama?ān and break your fast when you see the new moon of Shawwāl'. As for the elect, their fast is for God because of their witnessing God, and their breaking of the fast is through God, and their approach is to God and the One Who prevails over them is God and the One through Whom they are effaced is God.</text>

      <text>For days numbered; and if any of you be sick, or be on a journey, then a number of other days;</text>
      <text>Whoever is present in the month fasts for God and whoever is present with the Creator of the month fasts through God. The fast for God leads to recompense, while the fast through God leads to nearness. The fast for God is the fulfillment of worship (taḥqīq al-ʿibāda) and the fast through God is the healing of spiritual desire (taṣḥīḥ al-irāda). The fast for God is an attribute of every worshiper (ʿābid) and the fast by means of God is the quality of every seeker (qāṣid). The fast for God is the practice of external things (qiyām al-ẓawāhir) and the fast by means of God is the practice of inner things (qiyām al-damāÌir). The fast for God is abstention according to legal explanations (ʿibārāt al-sharīʿa) and the fast by means of God is abstention through the allusions of reality (ishārāt al-ḥaqīqa).</text>
      <text>Whoever is present in the month abstains from the things that break the fast, while whoever is present with the Real abstains at all times from witnessing created things.</text>
      <text>Whoever fasts with his lower self is given to drink from the drink of Salsabīl and Zanjabīl. Whoever fasts in his heart is given to drink from the drink of that which causes love through the blessing of affirmation. Those who fast with their innermost selves are those about whom God has said, 'He will give them a pure drink to drink' [76:21]. What a drink! A drink that is not turned about in the hand but rather appears for one from kindness, a drink of becoming intimate, not the drink of a cup.</text>
      <text>God Most High said, 'If any of you be sick, or be on a journey, then a number of other days', i.e., for anyone who breaks the fast for these reasons, there is a fast of a number of other days equaling those in which the fast was broken. The allusion is to one who is ailing in the health of his spiritual desire (irāda) and returns to other than Him, either through a permissive interpretation (rukhṣat taÌwīl) or because of a lack of strength or endurance, or a weakness in taking on the burdens of the decrees of reality.</text>

      <text>The month of Rama?ān, wherein the QurÌān was revealed, a guidance for the people, and as clear proofs of the Guidance and the Criterion; So let those of you, who are present at the month, fast it and if any of you be sick, or if he be on a journey, then a number of other days.</text>
      <text>Rama?ān burns (yurmi?u) the sins (dhunūb) of some people and burns the mortal traces (rusūm) of other people. What a difference between those whose sins are burnt by His mercy and those whose mortal traces are burnt by His reality!</text>
      <text>The month of Rama?ān is the month of the opening of the [divine] speech (khiṭāb), the month of the revelation of the Book (kitāb), the month of obtaining the reward (thawāb), the month of drawing near and affirmation (ījāb), the month of the lightening of burdens (takhfīf al-kulfa), the month of achieving intimacy (taḥqīq al-zulfa), the month of descending mercy (nuzūl al-raḥma), the month of granting blessing (wufūr al-niʿma), the month of salvation (najāt) and the month of intimate conversation (munājāt).</text>
      <text>[2:185 cont'd] God desires ease for you, and desires not hardship for you:</text>
      <text>'Because He desires ease for you, you should recognize that He desires only ease for you'. Among the signs that He wants ease for His servant is that He has brought about the search for ease. If He had not desired ease for him, He would not have placed a desire for it in him. The one who spoke for them said:</text>
      <text>If You had not wanted me to obtain</text>
      <text>that for which I hope and seek</text>
      <text>from Your generosity,</text>
      <text>You would not have taught me to seek.</text>
      <text>He gave hope and confirmed the desire, and made that giving binding inasmuch as He said, 'and He desires not hardship for you'. This was to negate the possibilities of other ways of thinking, leaving the true sense clearly spelled out.</text>
      <text>[2:185 cont'd] and that you fulfill the number</text>
      <text>According to the language of scholars (lisān al-ʿilm), [it is] 'that you fulfill the number [of days] of the fast'. According to the language of allusion (lisān al-ishāra), [it is] 'that in the clarity of the present state (ṣafāÌ al-ḥāl) you become aware of the fulfillment of the end (wafāÌ al-ma'āl)'.</text>
      <text>[2:185 cont'd] and magnify God for having guided you and that you might be thankful</text>
      <text>'in the final breath and that you might leave the numbered [days] of your life in the security of your faith. [God's] granting of success (tawfīq) in completing the fast of your month is great but the realization (taḥqīq) that your life is sealed with felicity is greater'.</text>

      <text>And when My servants question you concerning Me, I am near; I answer the call of the caller when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me, and let them believe in Me that they might go aright.</text>
      <text>The question of each one indicates his state. They did not ask about any decree, created thing, this world or what comes next, but rather they asked [Muḥammad] about Him, so God Most High said, 'And when My servants question you concerning Me...' [These questioners] were not among the group about whom He said, 'They will question you concerning the mountains', [20:105], nor among the group about whom He said, 'They will ask you about orphans' [2:220], nor among the group about whom He said, 'They will ask you about the monthly period' [2:222], nor among the group about whom He said, 'And they will question you concerning the Spirit' [17:85], nor among the group about whom He said, 'They ask you about wine, and divinatory arrows' [2:219], or 'They ask you about the sacred month, and fighting in it' [2:217].</text>
      <text>These were a select group of people. 'And when My servants question you concerning Me, how could you answer them? This answer is not by your tongue, O Muḥammad. Even though you are the ambassador between Us and created beings, I will assume responsibility for this answer: I am near'. He took away the act of mediating from anyone other than Himself concerning nearness. He did not say, 'Say to them I am near', but rather He said, may His affair be exalted, 'I am near'.</text>
      <text>Then He explained what this nearness is. Inasmuch as the Real (s) is too holy for drawing near or moving away in terms of direction, or specification in any spot (buqʿa), He said, 'I answer the call of the caller'. Verily the Real (s) is near, wholly and entirely, by means of knowledge, power, hearing and vision. He is near to the believers with respect to caretaking, help, and answering prayer, but He is too exalted and holy to be near to anyone in essence (dhāt) or spot (buqʿa), for He is uniquely without direction in any region, mighty without being described by substance or measure.</text>
      <text>I answer the call of the caller when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me, and let them believe in Me that they might go aright: He did not promise to answer the one who might be considered worthy because of asceticism or [to answer] at the time of worship.</text>

      <text>Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives; they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them; God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, and so He has turned to you [relenting], and He has pardoned you. So now, lie with them and seek what God has prescribed for you, and eat and drink until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak; then complete the fast to the night;</text>
      <text>He states that, in truth, those things which characterize human beings do not pertain to Him. Whether you are engaged in worship (ʿibāda), which is the right of the Real, or in the rules of custom (ʿāda) of companionship with your mate, which is the goal of your lower self and worldly concern, both are the same for your state when there is refined behavior (adab).</text>
      <text>The verse was revealed regarding the unexpected slip of al-Fārūq. He made that an occasion for a dispensation for all Muslims until the Resurrection. Thus are the rulings of the [divine] solicitude.</text>
      <text>It is said that He knew there is no escaping worldly concerns for the servant, so He divided the night and day in this month between His right (ḥaqq) and your worldly portion (ḥaẓẓ). He said, 'As for My right, complete the fast to the night, and as for your worldly portion, eat and drink until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak'.</text>
      <text>[2:187 cont'd] and do not lie with them, while you cleave to the mosques in devotion [to God]. Those are God's bounds; do not approach them. So, God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear.</text>
      <text>He states that the place of nearness is sanctified from the seeking of worldly concerns. He said, 'When you are occupied with your selves, you are veiled through yourselves in yourselves, but when your business is with Us do not turn back from Us to yourselves'.</text>
      <text>It is said the jealousy (ghayra) of the Real (s) is at the times when serious business is mixed with fun. ʿĀÌisha (ra) said concerning it: 'O Messenger of God, I truly love you and love being near to you.' He (ʿa) said, 'Let me be, daughter of Abū Bakr, I am worshipping my Lord.' He (ṣ) said to her: 'I have a time wherein none but my Lord suffices me.'</text>

For the people of the story, they are appointed times for their various states (aḥwāl). For the ascetics, [they are] appointed times for their litanies (awrād).

      <text>The allusion is that the ordeal that comes to hearts (qulūb) from the misfortunes of veiling is more grievous than that which comes to the bodily selves (nufūs) from the exertion of the spirit (rūḥ), because the passing away of the life of the heart is more grievous than the passing away of the life of the bodily self. This is because the life of bodily selves is through what is fitting and familiar to them, but the life of the heart can only be through God.</text>
      <text>It is said sedition is more grievous than slaying means that remaining apart from God is much worse than remaining with your spirit (ruḥ) and your life.</text>

That is to say, 'Hold completely to the precepts of spiritual disciplines (riyā?āt) until nothing remains of carnal human traces (āthār bashariyya). Submit the self (nafs) and heart (qalb) to God so there will be no opponent or combatant from within you, either by [your being] wary or receptive, by [your] directing or free choice, in any state.

      <text>It is also said, 'and cast not your own hands into destruction' means being unmindful of Him through free choice.</text>
      <text>It is also said [it is] imagining that you live without His kindness and His responsiveness for even a moment.</text>
      <text>It is also said [it is] contentment in your state of lassitude and being veiled.</text>
      <text>It is also said [it is] holding the tongue from perpetually seeking help in every breath.</text>
      <text>His words, 'But be virtuous, God loves the virtuous (muḥsinūn)': Virtuousness (iḥsān) is that you are kind with everyone but yourself, for your virtuousness towards your lower self is in a form that the thinking of those with poor judgment consider acting badly towards it. But through it you bring about every misery and endure every calamity. Virtuousness is also leaving every last bit of your worldly concerns, and devoting yourself to fulfilling the right of any one whose affair is connected to you. Virtuousness is that you worship Him without being neglectful and that you worship Him through the quality of witnessing.</text>

      <text>Fulfill the Pilgrimage and the Visitation to God;</text>
      <text>The fulfillment of the Pilgrimage according to the language of scholars is the performance of its basic elements, its practice, its form, and the shedding of blood which is required in it without abridging any of the conditions. It is mentioned in the tafsīr literature that you are forbidden from the dwellings of your family in both [the Pilgrimage and the Visitation].</text>
      <text>In the language of allusion the pilgrimage is the quest (qaṣd). The quest is to the House of the Real and the quest to the Real. The first is the pilgrimage of ordinary people and the second is the pilgrimage of the elect. Just as the one who makes the pilgrimage through his bodily self enters the consecrated state and stands [at ʿArafāt], circumambulates the House and runs [between Ṣafā and Marwa], and then shaves [his head], so it is with the one who makes the pilgrimage through his heart. His state of consecration (iḥrām) is through sound resolve (ʿaqd ṣaḥīḥ) on a pure quest (qaṣd ṣarīḥ). Then he removes the clothing of his oppositional aspects and his carnal passions. He then wraps himself in the two robes of patience and poverty. His holding back is from pursuing his worldly fortunes in following whims, and letting go of thoughts of desire, etc. Then [just as] as the pilgrim becomes more unkempt and dusty, likewise the traces of humility and submission appear upon [the pilgrim of the heart]. Then the talbiya of the innermost selves is in the responding of every part of you.</text>
      <text>'The most excellent of the actions of the pilgrimage (hajj) is the sacrificial blood-letting (thajj) and the crying out (ʿajj)'. The thajj is the pouring of blood [of the animal sacrificed] and the ʿajj is raising the voice in talbiya. Likewise, the shedding of the blood of the lower self is with the knives of opposition [to it], and the raising of the voices of the innermost self is in the continuous seeking of [God's] help and the beauty of the response. Then [there is the] standing at the plains of nearness, seeking perfection in the attributes of awe. The standing place of the bodily selves is ʿArafāt, while the standing place of hearts are the names and attributes belonging to the majesty of the Essence at the time of intimate communications.</text>

      <text>The Pilgrimage is in months well-known;</text>
      <text>The Pilgrimage for the outward selves (nufūs) is in months well-known. The iḥrām is only binding in it, and it is not possible to do the Pilgrimage throughout the entire year but only in a specific time period. One for whom that time has passed, the Pilgrimage has passed him. Likewise the Pilgrimage of the hearts has its times well-known and is only appropriate in them. These are the days of youth, for one who has no spiritual desire (irāda) in his youth, has no communion in the state of his old age. Likewise the one for whom the time of his quest (qaṣd) and spiritual desire (irāda) has passed, only the worship whose outcome is the Garden is appropriate, not the spiritual desire (irāda) whose outcome is communion.</text>
      <text>[2:197 cont'd] whoever undertakes the duty of Pilgrimage during them, then no lewdness, nor wickedness, or disputing in the Pilgrimage.</text>
      <text>The allusion is also to whoever travels the path of spiritual desire, that he should not stop at anything in the path nor mix his spiritual desire with anything. Whoever argues, opposes, or wrangles with him - he lets them all have their way. He will not dispute with anyone for the sake of this world, nor compete with anyone for some worldly fortune for the self or honor. God Most High said, 'And when the ignorant address them, they say "peace"' [25:63].</text>
      <text>[2:197 cont'd] Whatever good you do, God knows it.</text>
      <text>You should be content with His knowing and His judging rather than being seen, judged or known by His creatures.</text>

      <text>And when you have performed your holy rites is an allusion to carrying out the due of servanthood (ʿubudiyya). Remember God as you remember your fathers is an allusion to carrying out the due of love (maḥabba). The performance of your holy rites is undertaken by the self (nafs).</text>
      <text>Remember God as you remember your fathers is [something] one carries out for Him in the heart continuously in the moment (waqt) and with full engagement throughout the span of one's life (ʿumr).</text>
      <text>It is said that, 'Just as others boast of their fathers and delight in their ancestors, let your boasting and delight be in Us'.</text>
      <text>It is said that, 'If your fathers have a right to raise and educate you, Our right over you is even more binding since Our favors to you are more perfect'.</text>

      <text>It is said that, 'The father is remembered with respect and deference. Similarly, remember Us in awe along with the remembrance of the kindness of nearness through the best of caring'.</text>
      <text>He said: Remember God as you remember your fathers but did not say 'your mothers' because the father is remembered out of respect and the mother is remembered out of compassion for her. God shows mercy. He is not shown mercy.</text>
      <text>Or yet more intensely because the Real (ḥaqq) is more deserving (aḥaqq). You might be much estranged from your father while the Real (s) is far removed from any thought of one who has knowledge of Him to oppose what has been made obligatory in even the smallest way.</text>

      <text>He means in [this verse] good (ḥasana), the existence of which is consistent with all good things. The good by which all good things are obtained in this world is the protection of faith for them in the end. Surely whoever leaves this world as a believer will not remain in the Fire and the passing of this [world] will be of little consequence. The good which is consistent with the good things of the Hereafter is forgiveness, for when He forgives, there is nothing but every good after it.</text>
      <text>It is said the good in this world is aversion to it and the good in the Hereafter is protection from dwelling in [the Fire]. The guarding is from the Fire and the fires of separation (furqa) since the [letter] lām in His saying al-nār is a generic lām, so they seeking refuge applies to both the fires of burning (nīrān al-ḥurqa) and the fires of separation (nīrān al-furqa).</text>
      <text>It is said the good in this world is the witnessing by the innermost selves (bi'l-asrār) and in the Hereafter the vision by the physical eyes (bi'l-abṣār).</text>
      <text>It is said the good of this world is that He annihilates you from yourself, while the good of the Hereafter is that He returns you to yourself.</text>

      <text>This is a description of the last part of the [Pilgrimage] ceremonies, the throwing [of stones] in the days at Minā.

      <text>Those are peoples who have been seized by arrogance and no longer yield to equitable behavior. They turn up their noses at accepting the Real. When you enjoin such a one to decency, he says, 'How can you say this to someone like me, when I am such and such?' Then he turns it around and attacks you, saying, 'You have more need to be enjoined with decency and forbidden indecency, because your condition is such and such...' If God had granted success to help him or mercy had reached him, he would have been granted the favor of he who has been guided to seeing his error and informed of the evil of his attribute. And he would not have harbored enmity towards the one who gave him the advice, the traces of which remain in the heart for years.</text>
      <text>God Most High said: So Hell shall be enough for him, meaning the estrangement in his state, the darknesses of the soul and the constriction of free choice so that he does not hasten in anything except that which he desires. At every moment, over and over, he succumbs to the chastisement and trial. Then he is transported from this chastisement to the greater chastisement.

The opposite of this is the comforts of the hearts, which are immediate since they follow what is specified for drawing near (taqrīb). Happiness is in opposing (mukhālafa) the lower selves, so anyone who conforms (wāfaqa) with them has abandoned the exemplary path (al-maḥajjat al-muthlā).

      <text>is graver than slaying'.</text>
      <text>Among disobedient acts, there is that which is more intense than others and more difficult to conceptualize. Bad manners at the door do not bring about what they would bring about on the carpet. When the error occurs through the lower self, it affects it through the deferred punishment, which is burning (iḥtirāq). When the heart errs, the punishment is immediate, and it is through separation (firāq). The effect of heedlessness on hearts is more serious than the harm caused by error to the lower selves, for surely the lower self is kept from good fortune, but the heart is kept from the Real.</text>
      <text>[2:217 cont'd] They will not cease to fight against you until they turn you from your religion if they are able; and whoever of you turns from his religion, and dies disbelieving - their works have failed in this world and the Hereafter. Those are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this is to the people of heedlessness when they seek to lure you away, wanting to turn you towards their heedlessness. They will only be content when you break the contract of your spiritual desire (irāda) by returning to your previous state. Anyone who breaks (fasakha) his contract with God deforms (masakha) his heart.</text>

      <text>They ask you about wine (khamr), and divinatory arrows. Say: 'In both is great sin and profit for men; but the sin in them is greater than the usefulness'.</text>
      <text>Khamr is whatever intoxicates the mind. Just as the intoxicant is prohibited, so drunkenness (sukr) is prohibited by the words of the Prophet (ṣ), 'Khamr itself is prohibited and drunkenness from any drink' From the point of view of the allusions [in the verse], anyone who is drunk from the drink of heedlessness deserves the same as the drinker of khamr. Just as the one who is drunk is prohibited to pray, so the one who possesses the drunkenness of heedlessness is veiled from intimate communications (muwāṣalāt) and the plainest testimonial evidence of ecstatic finding (wujūd). Anyone who does not think this is true should test it.</text>
      <text>The notion of gambling can be found in most of the transactions of the people of heedlessness when they follow the way of stratagems, deception, and lying in what they say. Generous commitment to truthfulness and equitable justice is rare and precious.</text>
      <text>[2:219 cont'd-2:220] And they will ask you what they should expend. Say: 'Comfortably' (al-ʿafw). So, God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect, * on this world and the Hereafter.</text>
      <text>It is said al-ʿafw is what is in excess of your needs. This is for the elect who take from the surplus of their wealth according to their capacities. As for the elect of the elect, their way is 'preferring' (īthār), which is to prefer others over themselves even if they are in need of what they give, and even though the One they prefer is unseen.</text>
      <text>[2:220 cont'd] They will ask you about orphans. Say: 'To set their affairs aright; and if you intermix with them, they are your brothers;</text>
      <text>Setting their state aright with regards to their moral education (taÌdīb) is more perfect than setting aright their wealth. Patience in bearing with them through the giving of counsel, and abandoning one's weariness in guiding them is better than being permissive to the point where it could be said one had not faced their obligation.</text>
      <text>[2:220 cont'd] God knows well him who works corruption from him who sets aright; and had He willed He would have harassed you. Surely God is Mighty, Wise'.</text>
      <text>He deals with everyone according to what dwells in a person's heart in intentions (quṣūd), not according to the external things acquired in all the various ways.</text>

      <text>Do not marry idolatresses until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress, though you may admire her. And do not marry idolaters, until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater, though you may admire him. Those call to the Fire; and God calls to Paradise and pardon by His leave; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember.</text>
      <text>Connecting to the rope of religion and holding fast to the protection of Muslims is better than being content to reach a limit that enters upon disbelief. The concession of the law exists for this action, but the real indication is towards restraint by waiving the right to choose it. This concerns the women of the Book with whom it is permissible to have marital relations. As for polytheists, it is absolutely prohibited to have marital relations with them. It is a definitive judgment that cutting off relations with those in this category is obligatory.</text>

      <text>They will ask you about the monthly period. Say: 'It is an ailment; so part with women in the monthly period, and do not approach them until they are pure; when they have cleansed themselves, then come to them, as God has commanded you'.</text>
      <text>Not everything which is a cause for embarrassment and aversion is from what the servant freely chooses, for it might be among the deficiencies whose acquisition cannot be attributed to the servant, but rather is, from the beginning, a decree of the Real. Among these is what God destined for the daughters of Adam in this condition. Moreover, they were commanded to withdraw from the place of prayer during the times of this condition since the place of prayer is a place of intimate conversation (manājin) with one's Lord. So setting a time in which the place of conversation is to be avoided is a decree from God, not a sin of theirs. In this is an allusion, for it is said that even if they are prevented from prayer, which is being present through the body, they are not prevented from perpetual remembrance (dhikr) in the heart and tongue. That is an address on the carpet of nearness. The Prophet (ṣ) said, relating from God Most High, 'I am the sitting companion of him who remembers Me'.</text>
      <text>[2:222 cont'd] Truly, God loves those who repent, and He loves those who cleanse themselves.</text>

      <text>It is said those who repent from error and those who cleanse themselves from imagining that their salvation is through repentance.</text>
      <text>It is said those who repent from doing forbidden things and those who cleanse themselves from familiar things and ordinary considerations.</text>

      <text>It is said those who repent from error and those who cleanse themselves from heedlessness.</text>

Because the wife has a lesser voice due to her being captive (asīr) in the hands of her spouse, God (s) takes charge of the affair in protecting her right and commands the husband to return to her or release her.</text>

      <text>Divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods.</text>
      <text>He commanded divorced women to wait, out of respect for spousal relations, meaning, 'if the relationship has been cut off between the two of you, observe the condition of fulfilling [the waiting period] for the sake of what occurred in the past in the relationship. Do not put others quickly in place of [the spouse]. Be patient until the allotted period has passed.' Don't you see that the bride whose marriage was not consummated is not commanded to undergo a waiting period, since there were no spousal relations between the two of them?</text>
      <text>[2:228 cont'd] And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs if they believe in God and the Last Day.</text>
      <text>It means that even if the tie between the two of you has been severed, do not severe what God has established in the parental relationship.</text>
      <text>[2:228 cont'd] Their mates have a better right to restore them</text>

      <text>[2:228 cont'd] in such time if they desire to set things right;</text>
      <text>It means that the [husband's] intention to return should be to set things right in the estrangement that occurred, not to prolong the waiting period for her if he has resolved to divorce her after he has taken her back.</text>
      <text>[2:228 cont'd] women shall have rights similar to those due from them, with justice;</text>
      <text>It means if he has a right over her for what he has expended in wealth, she has a right for prior service in the situation.</text>

      <text>He calls for the separating of the divorce formula, so that you will not rush to complete the separation. Regarding its meaning it is said;</text>
      <text>If I discover that</text>
      <text>you have resolved on slaying me</text>
      <text>then leave me.</text>
      <text>Little by little, I am becoming weaker.</text>
      <text>[2:229 cont'd] then honourable retention; or setting free kindly.</text>
      <text>Either a gracious relationship or a gracious separation. Bad marital life and the loss of pleasantries through blameworthy character traits are not acceptable on the path (ṭarīqa) nor is it praiseworthy in the law (sharīʿa).</text>
      <text>[2:229 cont'd] It is not lawful for you to take of what you have given them</text>
      <text>For surely the report is, 'Anyone who asks for his gift back is like someone asking for his own vomit'. Returning what you have ruined is contemptible.</text>
      <text>[2:229 cont'd] unless the couple fear that they may not maintain God's bounds. If you fear they may not maintain God's bounds, neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself.</text>
      <text>It means that if the woman wants to free herself from her husband, she is not at fault in what she gives up in wealth, for truly the self is worth everything to its owner. If the man, when he loses the companionship of the woman, could receive something from her, then at least he would receive some wealth for the loss of comfort in the situation.</text>
      <text>[2:229 cont'd] Those are God's bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God's bounds - those are the evildoers.</text>
      <text>These are the good manners (ādāb) which God has taught you and made as a way (sunna) for you, so be mindful of his bounds (ḥudūd) and persist in recognizing His rights (ḥuqūq).</text>

      <text>If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful to him after that, until she marries another husband. If he divorces her, then neither of them would be at fault to return to each other,</text>
      <text>A man finds it unbearable that his wife should marry another, so [God] prevents him from choosing separation with the intention of keeping her from remarrying. He explains that she will not be lawful for him once he has separated from her until she does what he would find unbearable, and that is a second marriage. So he will be cautious, as much as he is able, in [initiating] divorce. Then He said: If he divorces her, meaning the spouse, then neither of them would be at fault to return to each other, meaning her remarrying the first husband.</text>
      <text>The allusion in it is that love's capture of the heart makes the endurance of every misery easy, for if after separating, the spouses feel regret for their lost union, and then the greatest remorse, there is no fault in their returning to each other. The woman in this circumstance is as if she is protected from the first husband by the place of the second husband while the husband is like one who has brought this on himself in permitting that.</text>
      <text>[2:230 cont'd] if they think that they will maintain God's bounds. Those are God's bounds, which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge.</text>
      <text>It means that when they know their need for each other as companions, they will not separate a second time. The one who spoke for them said:</text>
      <text>I swore that if I met you</text>
      <text>one more time,</text>
      <text>I would never again separate from you</text>

      <text>The verse contains a prohibition for guardians against hurting [the women under their protection], renouncing the violent anger of the time of ignorance (jahliyya) and yielding to the decree of God in giving women in marriage if they wish it, without indignation or rage. Rather, 'since you were sufficiently pleased to betroth her to a mate, it is prohibited to [then] oppress her'. The dissolving of human attributes by the subjugation of the lower self is a more intense struggle and a more sincere transaction for the sake of God.</text>

      <text>Mothers suckle their children for two full years for such as desire to fulfill the suckling.</text>
      <text>The consummate metaphor for mercy is the mercy of mothers. God (s) commanded mothers to be fully merciful in suckling their children for two complete years. Cutting off the suckling before two years is an allusion to the fact that the mercy of God towards his servant is more perfect than the mercy of mothers.</text>
      <text>[2:233 cont'd] It is for the father to provide them and clothe them honorably.</text>
      <text>It means the father must provide for nursing women and clothe them honorably. When they are performing an act for you, their right is your obligation. Surely the one who is entirely yours is entirely your responsibility.</text>
      <text>[2:233 cont'd] No soul is charged save to its capacity;</text>
      <text>The holding back of one who has ability is miserliness - to stop in a moment of weakness is an excuse.</text>
      <text>[2:233 cont'd] a mother a shall not be harmed by her child</text>
      <text>in the suckling and what is necessary for it.</text>
      <text>[2:233 cont'd] neither a father by his child. The heir has a similar duty.</text>
      <text>It means the father by his child, meaning what is obligatory to him in support and tenderness. Just as the right of the child is incumbent on the parents, the right of the parents is incumbent on the child.</text>
      <text>[2:233 cont'd] But if the two desire by mutual consent and consultation to wean, then they would not be at fault. And if you desire to seek nursing for your children, you would not be at fault, provided you hand over what you have given honorably, and fear God, and know that God sees what you do.</text>
      <text>It means the weaning before two years - after the right intention, there is no fault. The verse includes [that which] smoothes the path of companionship, teaching the best morals in the precepts of marital life. Surely those who are not merciful will not themselves be treated with mercy (wa-inna man lā yarḥam lā yurḥam). The Prophet (ṣ) said to someone who mentioned that his children didn't kiss him, 'Surely God does not take away mercy except for the one with a miserable heart'.</text>

      <text>Because the right of the dead is more important since his separation is not by choice, the period [for the widow] to complete used to be longer. In the beginning of Islam, the waiting period after death was one year. However it reverted to four months and ten days to verify that no sperm of the husband is present in the womb. When the waiting period comes to an end, she is permitted to marry another husband. No one's fidelity lasts to the end of life, as it is said:</text>

      <text>If you have initiated the union with your mates, but then change your mind [before the consummation], there is no fault for you in choosing separation if you wish, for there is only One Whom it is not permissible to choose to separate from. The companionship of human beings with one another is not obligatory but rather is at most prescribed as permissible. But because your name and reputation is now part of theirs, half of the determined amount [of the dowry] must belong to them, for the separation, however it came about, is difficult. So He has appointed what is necessary in compensation to remain with her upon being made to drink the cup of separation. If there was no determined amount, the contract still requires the gift (mutaʿ), for her being made to drink the cup of separation without [some compensatory] comfort is a terrible trial.</text>

      <text>Then He mentioned that remission is more perfect and more commendable, either on the part of the woman in the half due to her or from the husband in the half returning to him.</text>
      <text>[2:237 cont'd] Forget not kindness between you; surely God sees what you do.</text>
      <text>It is said that whoever is remiss in kindness and is content with the obligatory will soon neglect the obligatory [as well].</text>
      <text>It is said that forgetting kindness brings one closer to stinginess. Part of the way of the noble (sunnat al-kirām) is that when there are no obvious occasions for acting with nobility, they sharpen the eyes of generosity to look for its more subtle kindnesses, and their calls for these are amply fulfilled.</text>

      <text>When they viewed it farfetched that they would return by God's power, He showed them this directly in their own selves. The manifestation of that, however, did not benefit those who had not sharpened their insight regarding divine unity (tawḥīd). Anyone whose insight has been strengthened will not be harmed by a lack of these direct forms of evidence, for they have already confirmed what they have been told through their faith in the Unseen.</text>

      <text>Who is he that will lend God a loan that is good, and He will multiply it for him manifold?</text>
      <text>The loan is called qar? because one 'cuts off' (yaqṭaʿu) something from one's wealth in order to give it to a borrower. When the almsgiver 'cuts' alms (ṣadaqa) from his wealth, his gift is called qar? because it is the bit cut off. But what is designated by the term qar? and its articulation is in keeping with the hearts of the lovers inasmuch as He speaks directly to you on the subject of almsgiving through it.</text>
      <text>It is said the verse suggests the importance of the wealthy since He questioned them about the loan, but the rank of the poor is even more important in this because He asked about the loan on their behalf. He might ask for the loan from anyone but he did not ask it for the sake of just anyone. In the tradition: The Messenger of God (ṣ) died while his coat of mail was pawned with Abū Shaḥma the Jew for barley, which he had taken to feed his family. Look from whom he borrowed and for the sake of whom he borrowed!</text>
      <text>It is said the good loan is one for which you do not look for a reward and do not seek recompense.</text>
      <text>It is said the good loan is not given in a heedless way, but rather from witnessing [what is needed].</text>
      <text>It is said the good loan, according to religious scholars, is given only when one has the means. According to the most respected (al-akābir), it is the condition of preferring others [to one's self] in giving without any hesitation.</text>
      <text>It is said the good loan according to the religious scholars is 2.5%. According to the folk, it is giving all generously, including one's spirit.</text>
      <text>[2:245 cont'd] God straitens (yaqbi?) and enlarges (yabsuṭ); and to Him you shall be returned.</text>
      <text>He takes hold (yaqbi?) of the alms from the rich with the grasp (qab?) of His acceptance, and opens (yabsuṭ) for them the largesse (basṭ) of His recompense.</text>
      <text>It is said He straitens (yaqbi?) the provision, i.e., 'He restricts' (yu?ayyiqu); and enlarges the provision, i.e., 'He expands' (yuwassiʿu). He straitens the poor in order to test them in patience and enlarges the rich so as to lay claim to their gratitude.</text>

      <text>Have you not seen the council of the Children of Israel after Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, 'Send for us a king, and we will fight in God's way'. He said, 'Might it be that if fighting is prescribed for you, you will not fight?'</text>
      <text>They took on the matter by their own choice (ikhtiyār) and demanded that their prophet ask permission for them to fight. When they were granted what they were themselves answerable to, they turned to laziness (takāsul), and veered off course into their familiar territories of desertion (takhādhul) and knowing neglect (taghāful). It is said they did show strength and rigor in fighting to defend their possessions and their dwellings since:</text>
      <text>[2:246 cont'd] They said, 'Why should we not fight in God's way, when we have been expelled from our habitations and our children?' Yet when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs, except a few of them; and God has knowledge of the evildoers.</text>
      <text>But because of [their motive] they did not achieve their objective because their resolve was not purely for the right of God. If they had said, 'Why should we not fight in the way of God for He has commanded us, and made [this] an obligation to us? He is our Chief and Protector, and His command is binding on us', then perhaps they would have fully achieved what they had set out to do.</text>

They said, 'How can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship, seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealth?' He said, 'God has chosen him over you and has increased him broadly in knowledge and body (jism). God gives the kingship to whom He will; and God is Embracing, Knowing.</text>
      <text>They forgot [God's] right of free choosing (ikhtiyār), viewing the situation instead with the eye of the external world. They deemed it unlikely that Saul could be a king because he was poor and without property. [God] explained to them that merit is by the choice of the Real and that if he lacked wealth, 'God has increased him in knowledge and has favored him over you by his knowledge and body (jism)'. It is said He meant that he was praiseworthy in the qualities of the self (nafs), not large in [his] physical frame (binya), for as it is said in the adage, 'So and so is a name without a body (fulān ism bi-lā jism)', i.e. a man without substance.</text>

      <text>And their prophet said to them, 'The sign of his kingship is that there will come to you the Ark. Therein is a Spirit of Peace from your Lord, and a remnant of what the folk of Moses and the folk of Aaron left behind, the angels bearing it. Surely in that shall be a sign for you if you are believers'.</text>
      <text>Verily when God (s) makes a light appear, He increases it with help from Himself. When Saul was made king over them, the doubt about his qualification was eliminated by the appearance of [God's] signs proving the veracity of the words of their prophet in choosing him. He returned the Ark which contained the Spirit of Peace (sakīna) to them. Thus the sign of his kingship became clear to them and the fact that their prophet (ʿa) had spoken truly to them in what he told them.</text>
      <text>It is said that God Most High placed the Spirit of Peace (sakīna) of the Children of Israel in the Ark which contained the shards of the tablets and the rod of Moses (ʿa), and [other] relics of their possessors of prophecy. He placed the Spirit of Peace of [Muḥammad's] community in their hearts: He it is Who sent down the spirit of Peace into the hearts of the believers [48:4]. Then verily the Ark circulated in the hands of enemies and others. One time it was buried, another time it was seized and carried away, another time it was returned, and another time [and so on...]. As for the hearts of the believers, He comes between their possessors and [the Spirit of Peace]. He did not entrust it to a king or a prophet, or to the heavens or air, or to a place or person. The Prophet (ṣ) said, 'The heart of the believer is between the two fingers of the Merciful', meaning in the grasp of the Real (s) and under His mastery (taglīb) and disposition (taṣrīf). What is meant by it is the divine power of deliberate action (qudra). What a difference between a community whose Spirit of Peace is in what enemies can control and a community whose Spirit of Peace is in that over which no created being has any control!</text>

      <text>And when Saul went forth with the hosts, he said, 'God will try you with a river; whoever drinks of it, is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except for him who scoops up with his hand.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this verse is that God (s) tests human beings in their association with others, with this world, and with the lower self. There are some whose association with these things is limited to that which is required for basic livelihood and what is necessary for their salvation and security. There are others who go beyond the limit of what is required, extending their association with things of the world, self and creation for the sake of carnal desire and preference. There is nothing from God in something which involves doing a prohibited thing. There is nothing from this path (ṭarīqa) that is not by His hand.</text>

      <text>So, when they went forth against Goliath and his troops, they exonerated themselves of all power and strength and turned to God, seeking His succor, asking for His aid, and trusting in His help. They said, 'Our Lord, pour out upon us patience, and make firm our feet: they sought firmness and patience at first for the sake of the sufferings they had previously endured, but then they said, 'and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!' The most important of their concerns was patience and standing up to the enemy, and only after that help for themselves. Patience is the right of the Real (ḥaqq al-ḥaqq) while help is their portion. They stepped forward to assert His right (s) and to succeed for His sake, and then to find what was theirs for their worldly concerns and portion from [His] help. Moreover they indicated that they were seeking help against them, not out of revenge for what had been taken from them, but because they were disbelievers, the enemies of God. They stood in every way for God through God. Because of that they were helped and found victory.</text>

      <text>God frightened the enemies with Saul since He has given him such a large body, but at the time of the fighting He made the victory at the hands of David. As the story goes, he was of middling stature, not large in body, a compact person. He had no weapon with him but a slingshot, but the victory was his because the help of God (s) was with him.</text>
      <text>And they routed them, by the leave of God so that nothing, not even a trace remained of them. David killed Goliath. Because of Goliath's bulk and size, David's victory over him was unimaginable, but as the one who spoke for them said:</text>

      <text>God, there is no god, except Him, the Living, the Eternal Sustainer.</text>
      <text>Allāh is a name (ism) which only the Real (s) possesses. There is no namesake (samī) for Him with it. God Most High said, 'Do you know [of] anyone who could be His namesake?' [19:65], i.e., 'Do you know anyone other than Him that could be called Allāh?' Anyone who regards this as a derived term is like someone lost in oppositional tendencies. This is a term which denotes worthiness of the attributes of Majesty, not some derivation from [other] words. There are no parallels for what has no parallel in words.</text>
      <text>His words, 'there is no god, except Him' is a statement that negates anything equivalent or similar to that which He has a title to in sanctity (taqdīs) and incomparability (tanzīh). Anyone who attests to this statement will not see so much as a speck to affirm in anything other than Him or from anything other than Him, so he will not bring up his need before any other, nor bear witness to a speck of anything other than Him. His concentration on Him is steady and his singular devotion to finding Him is perpetual. So he does not hear except from God and through God, and he does not witness anything except through God, and he does not approach anything but God, and he does not occupy himself with anything except through God. He is effaced from what is other than God and therefore he has no complaints or requests. Not a drop of blood moves in him for anything other than Him. When the Real gives to a servant in full measure, absolutely no possibility remains in him for worldly concerns. Surely then the truth of this statement [there is no god, except Him] must be acknowledged and all other ways of describing things must be obliterated. The truth to be realized is that there is no access for any creature to the existence of the Real (s), no union or parting, no nearness or distance, for truly those are all defects which are not worthy of the timeless eternal.</text>
      <text>The Living (ḥayy), the Eternal Sustainer (qayyūm): The One who takes charge of the affairs (mutawallā) of His servants, the One who is concerns Himself (qāÌim) with every movement and stillness, the One who sets in motion (mujrī) every perceived thing (ʿayn) and effect (athar).</text>

This punishment is in actuality more powerful in its effect, if they had eyes to see. The Real (s) states that Abraham (ʿa) moved with the accursed enemy from one sound proof to another which was clearer, not because there was anything wrong with the [first] proof, but because of the shortcomings in the understanding of the disbeliever.

So God made him die a hundred years, then he raised him up; He, said, 'How long have you tarried?'; he said, 'I have tarried a day, or part of a day'; He said, 'Nay; you have tarried a hundred years. Look at your food and drink, it has not spoiled; and look at your ass so that We would make you a sign for the people. And look at the bones, how We shall set them up, and then clothe them with flesh'. So, when it was made clear to him, he said, 'I know that God has power over all things'.</text>
      <text>This was not a question of denial, a matter of ignorance, or an indication of doubt in the [divine] power of deliberation, since this report is about Ezra (ʿUzayr) the prophet (ʿa) and it is not possible for the prophets (ʿa) to doubt or be ignorant. Rather, it was a question of amazement. In this conversation [Ezra] wanted an increase in certainty, so God showed him that in himself by making him die and then bringing him to life, and then reviving his ass while he watched. He became more and more certain. Demanding certainty from God and the tactic of posing difficulties is the practice of oppositional people, but God excused Ezra in this conversation and even ordained for him the increased certainty he sought. Then he said, 'I know that God has power over all things' in giving life and causing death, i.e., 'My knowledge has been increased by what I saw. He showed me that which increased my certainty from powerful signs'. His food and drink did not change in this long period.

      <text>There are two types of expending: the expending of worshippers (ʿābidūn) and the expending of ecstatics (wājidūn). When worshippers expend grain, it multiplies for them seventy times to what beyond reckoning. As for the ecstatics, it is as is said:</text>

      <text>Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with reminder of their generosity and injury, their wage is with their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve.</text>
      <text>The reminder is witnessing what you did. The injury is pointing out your beneficence to the one who receives it.</text>
      <text>It is said they expend what they expend, but they most assuredly do not say anything about their actions or works.</text>
      <text>It is said, 'How can you give something and ask for your own right in return for it?'</text>
      <text>It is said they do not remind others of what they have done for them, but rather bear witness to the favor of God in granting them success for that.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, annul not your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury, as one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil, and a torrent smites it, and leaves it barren. They have no power over anything that they have earned. God guides not the disbelieving folk.</text>
      <text>Rather the beauty of the gift comes from the Real (s). There is no gift from created beings that is attributable to anyone other than Him. Indeed, gifts that come from created beings are the greatest test (miḥna), while witnessing the gift from God is the greatest blessing (niʿma). The one who spoke for them said: There is no humility</text>
      <text>in your honoring important people.</text>
      <text>On the contrary,</text>
      <text>humility is that you honor the lowly.</text>
      <text>It is said the poorest of creatures is the one who thinks himself fortunate, for his bankruptcy will become clear to him. Similarly the least of creatures in value is one who thinks that he has something, for what he did not reckon with will appear to him from God.</text>

      <text>But the likeness of those who expend their wealth, seeking God's good pleasure, and to confirm themselves is as the likeness of a garden upon a hill; a torrent smites it and it yields its produce twofold; if no torrent smites it, then dew, and God sees what you do. * Would any of you wish to have a garden of date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it, for him there is in it all manner of fruit, then old age smites him, and he has seed, but they are weak; then a whirlwind with fire smites it, and it is consumed. So, God makes clear the signs to you, so that you might reflect.</text>
      <text>These are numerous signs which God mentions by way of striking similitudes for the one who is sincere and the hypocrite, for the one who expends in the way of God and the one who expends his wealth in vain. These will obtain honor and recompense (khalaf) for themselves and those will receive only rejection in the present and nothing but ruin (talaf) in the end. The effort of these remains worthy of thanks (mashkūr), while those leave behind destruction (thubūr) and come to a blazing flame. The works of these thrive, their wealth grows, their states rising high before God, and their end will be communion. The works of those will come to nothing; their states will be of loss, their hopes sealed by misfortune, and their curse doubled for them.</text>
      <text>It is said the similitude of these is like one who planted seed, his property thrived, and his surplus grew. His branch became high and his benefit multiplied. The similitude of those is like one whose bargaining has failed, his commodity stolen, and his stratagem weakened in old age. His tribulations continued one after the other, in every way and in every time. How can these two be equal as an example? Do they have any resemblance to one another?</text>

      <text>Let everyone consider what he expends for the sake of himself and what he has produced by the command of his Lord. That which is taken against you is from your account book (diwān): What belongs to your worldly portion are the precious things you possess, and what belongs to your Lord are the things of little value from your wealth. That which is [given by you] for God's sake is but a morsel, while that which is [given by God] for your sake is the most in value and the most perfect in blessing. Then see how He forgives you, and even accepts it from you. Nay, look how He compensates you. Nay, look how He praises you for it, look how he ascribes it to you. Everything from Him is a favor but He ascribes it to you as an act. Therefore His gift is entrusted to you and the gift is called a reward. He enriches you by granting you success in kindness, and then the world swells with gratitude from you.</text>

      <text>For the poor (fuqarāÌ), who are constrained in the way of God; and they are unable to journey in the land; the ignorant man supposes them rich because of their abstinence; but you shall know them by their mark; they do not beg of men importunately. And whatever good you expend, surely God has knowledge of it.</text>
      <text>The authority of reality (sulṭān al-ḥaqīqa) has obstructed every way for them; there is no way for them to travel to the east and no place to camp to the west. Whichever way they look, they see the large tents of God's unity (tawḥīd) surrounding them:</text>
      <text>It is as if the wide road of the earth,</text>
      <text>with all its vastness,</text>
      <text>became narrow for me,</text>
      <text>but it neither increased in length nor width.</text>
      <text>They do not take a single breath with created beings. Where would that come from when there are no created beings? And if there are none, then to affirm what is not is an act of ascribing partnership in God's oneness.</text>
      <text>The sincere poor man (faqīr) stands with God through God. Outsiders cannot behold him and created beings have no way to him. [God] makes them appear in the eyes of others in clothes like theirs. God Most High said, 'the ignorant man supposes them rich because of their abstinence'. But for those who possess insight, there is no ambiguity in anything in their states. 'You shall know them, O Muḥammad, by their mark'. This mark is not one that appears to the physical eye but a mark that insight perceives. There is no beholding them except by the light of oneness.</text>
      <text>It is said you will know them by their mark, [which is] the rejoicing of their hearts at the breaking of their lower selves, and the crying out of their innermost selves to the throne as their outward form withers beyond recovery.</text>
      <text>It is said the brokenness of the outward form comes with the brokenness of the inward. On the contrary [with these poor], they do not beg of men importunately. If they do beg from created beings without being importune, as the [QurÌānic] address suggests, that is a protection for them and for the secret of their story because creatures will not view them as begging. In their innermost selves, there is not a speck of affirmation for anything other [than God].</text>
      <text>It is said [regarding those] who are constrained in the way of God that they hold to the decree of God and constrain their lower selves in obedience to Him, their hearts in knowing Him, their spirits in loving Him, and the innermost selves in seeing Him.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, when you contract a debt, one upon another for a stated term, write it down; and let a writer write it down between you justly; and let not any writer refuse to write it down, as God has taught him; so let him write, and let the debtor dictate; and let him fear God his Lord, and not diminish anything of it. And if the debtor be a fool, or weak, or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate justly. And summon to bear witness, two witnesses, men; or if the two be not men, then one man and two women, such witnesses as you approve of, so that if one of the two women errs; the other will remind her; and let the witnesses not refuse, whenever they are summoned; and be not disdainful to write it down, small or great, with its term; that is more equitable in God's sight, more upright for testimony, and nearer, that you will not be in doubt, unless it be trade carried out there and then that you give and take between you, then you will not be at fault if you do not write it down. And take witnesses when you are trading with one another. And let not either writer or witness be pressed; and if you do, that is sinfulness in you. And fear God. God teaches you and God knows all things. * And if you are upon a journey, and you do not find a writer, then a pledge in hand.

      <text>Alif Lām Mīm</text>
      <text>By His saying, 'Alif', He alludes to His being sufficient for you in all of your states. You are captive to heedlessness, and are not rightly guided to your [potential] righteousness and integrity. He is the One who sets in motion what restores you, and is solely sufficient for you in what helps you. Without your asking - and even without you knowing your state - He suffices for you even if you do not perceive it. He gives to you without your seeking. The allusion from the Lām is to His kindness (luṭf) to you at the most subtle and hidden level so much so that the locus of favor by which He strengthens you is not apparent to you. The allusion from the Mīm is to conformity (muwāfaqa) to the stream of the [divine] ordainment (taqdīr) through the circumstances requested by the friends. Nothing in the world moves, no particle appears unless it is an occasion of good pleasure with respect to them. It would not be going too far to say that in His words, Every day He is upon some matter [55:29], the 'matter' is an actualization of what the friends desire.</text>
      <text>It is said that by listening to these disconnected letters [Alif Lām Mīm], which are contrary to the customs of human discourse, every concept disappears from the hearts, whether it be a known, written, customary or imagined thing, and whether it arises from necessity (?arūra), sensory perception (ḥiss) or independent reasoning (ijitihād). When the hearts are emptied of imagined and known concepts, and the innermost selves are purified of customary and familiar things, the name Allāh comes to a heart sanctified from everything other (than Him) and to an innermost self purified of every mode [of inquiry] (kayf).</text>

      <text>You did not know, O Muḥammad, what the Book was, nor the story of the lovers. But a matter of pre-eternal choosing came suddenly upon you, and cast you into an amazing affair, its proof sublime, its place of descent and occurrence precious.</text>
      <text>[3:3 cont'd] confirming what was before it</text>
      <text>i.e., verifying His promise to you in the books that came through the prophets (ʿa).</text>
      <text>[3:3 cont'd-3:4] and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel * before as guidance to people, and He revealed the Criterion.</text>
      <text>That is to say, 'Even though We revealed Our books to the messengers before you, We did not omit the remembrance (dhikr) of you from any book'. The one who spoke for them said:</text>

      <text>are pages.</text>
      <text>The remembrance of you</text>
      <text>is their title page.</text>
      <text>Just as We have extended the lights of the prophets through you, We have adorned all that We have revealed in remembrances with your remembrance.</text>
      <text>[3:4 cont'd] As for those who disbelieve in God's signs, for them awaits a terrible chastisement.</text>
      <text>[The chastisement] is the ignominy of the veil but they do not perceive [this].</text>

      <text>He it is Who revealed to you the Book, wherein are verses [that are] clear, forming the Mother Book, and others allegorical. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow the allegorical part, desiring sedition, and desiring its interpretation, and none knows its interpretation, save God. And for those firmly rooted in knowledge (al-rāsikhūn fī'l-ʿilm), say, 'We believe in it; all is from our Lord'; yet none remembers [yatadhakkaru], but people of pith.</text>
      <text>He classified the [divine] speech for them; in its exoteric sense its revelation is clear (fa-min ẓāhirin wā?iḥu tanzīlihi) and in its obscure sense its interpretation is difficult (wa-min ghāmi?in mushkilu taÌwīlihi). The first portion is for explaining the Law and to guide the people of the exoteric sense. The second portion is to protect the disclosure of secrets from the viewing of outsiders. The way of the scholars (ʿulamāÌ) is to be firmly rooted (rusūkh) in seeking its meaning in conformity with the basic foundations (uṣūl) [of the religion], and what is attained by [this type of] inquiry meets with acceptance. They leave that which cannot be known by mental examination (fikr) to the world of the Unseen. The way of the people of allusion (ishāra) and understanding (fahm) is to listen with the presence of the heart (ḥu?ūr al-qalb). The glimmers of information that come to their understanding are based on the allusions of unveiling (kashf). If they have been asked to maintain the veil and conceal the secret, they feign dumbness. If they have been commanded to reveal and disseminate, they give voice to the explanation of the Real and speak of the information of the Unseen. Those who have been supported by the lights of insights are illuminated by the rays of the suns of understanding. Those who are clothed in the covering of doubt have been denied the subtleties of realization. Their states are fractured, conjectures assail them and they are swept away in torrents of doubt and deception. Their ignorance only increases their denial and their estrangement only increases their uncertainty.</text>
      <text>And none knows its interpretation, save God: The faith of those who find their knowledge from God will not suffer from meandering thoughts permitting [questionable interpretation]. Rather [their faith will be based] upon clear statements of plain meaning and sincere articulations of certainty. As for those with awakened intellects, they are in the company of remembrance (tadhakkur) because of the appearance of demonstrative proofs and the careful examination of the principles of obtaining [knowledge].</text>

Among the problematic crossroads [on the path] is relying on what comes to you from the various ways of drawing near. It is like the circumstance of someone confiding in you and he flatters you. In every kindness he describes and praises you but under it is a hidden deception. [Instead] felicity comes to you by His unveiling to you through the witnessing of His Majesty and Beauty, not through His affirming you in the kindness of your states, nor through what you have been chosen for in His favors and drawing you near.</text>

      <text>Patience is restraint of the lower self and consists of three levels: patience with what the servant has been commanded to do, patience with what has been prohibited him, and patience standing under the flow of His decree (ḥukm) according to what He desires, either in the passing away of what you love or in the onslaughts (hujūm) outside of your control. When you rise beyond this quality in your being unaffected by any difficulty or comfort received, it is through contentment (ri?ā), not patience (ṣabr).</text>
      <text>It is said the patient with the command of God, sincere in what they have promised God, obedient with their selves in pursuing the straight way in love of God, imploring God's pardon from all they have done because they see how much they have fallen short with God.</text>
      <text>It is said the patient in their hearts, sincere in their spirits, obedient in their lower selves, and imploring God's pardon by their tongues.</text>
      <text>It is said the patient with sincerity of seeking (quṣūd), sincere in contracts (ʿuhūd), obedient in protecting the limits (ḥudūd), and imploring God's pardon for their acts and states when the authority of divine unity (tawḥīd) takes over.</text>
      <text>It is said the patient are those who are patient in seeking (ṭalab), not looking to escape (harab), not ashamed to face toil (taʿab), and they renounce every comfort and intense emotion (ṭarab). They are patient in tribulation (wa-ṣabarū ʿalā'l-balwā) and reject complaining (wa-rafa?ū'l-shakwā) until they come to the Protector (ḥattā waṣalū ilā'l-mawlā). Nothing cuts them off in the present world and the world to come (al-dunyā wa'l-uqbā).</text>
      <text>The sincere are those who are firm and bold (ṣadaqū) in seeking. They proceed with purpose (qaṣadū) and with firmness and boldness (ṣadaqū) until they arrive (waradū), then they are firm and bold until they witness (shahidū), then they are firm and bold until they find (wajadū), then they are firm and bold until they are lost (faqadū). Their sequence is seeking (quṣūd), then arriving (wurūd), then witnessing (shuhūd), then finding (wujūd), then extinction (khumūd).</text>
      <text>The obedient are those who stay at the door (bāb), persevering in drinking sorrow (iktiÌāb). They abandon things which they love (maḥābb) and reject companions (aṣḥāb) in order to recognize the truth by drawing near (iqtirāb).</text>

      <text>God bears witness that there is no god, except Him,</text>
      <text>i.e., God knows, God informs, and God rules that there is no god, except Him. It is the bearing witness of the Real to the Real that He is the Real. The first one to bear witness that He is God is God and He bears witness in His eternity by His words (qawl), His speaking (kalām), and His primordial address (khiṭāb). He has given information of His singular existence, His eternal being, His everlasting unseen, His continuous essence, His eternal majesty and His endless beauty. He said, 'God bears witness', then, throughout all time.</text>
      <text>God bears witness, i.e., God makes things clear by what He demonstrates in proofs (barāhīn), establishes in indicators of certainty (dalāÌil al-yaqīn), makes manifest in signs (ayāt), and discloses in indisputable evidence (bayyināt). In all that He has created and brought forth, and made manifest from the concealment of non-existence, and produced according to what He wills, from independent things that are perceived (ʿayān) and the vanishing traces [left by things, actions or attributes] (āthār), from the essential qualities of things (dhawāt) in their potentiality and the attributes (ṣifāt) which come to be in specific places - each part [of this whole] is a clear expression of His existence and a plain elucidation of His Lordship, a witness (shāhid) to His Eternity, and a notifier to the intellects that He is One (wāḥid), Mighty, and Glorious (mājid). He (s) bore witness to the majesty (jalāl) of His Measure and the perfection (kamāl) of His Might at the time when there was no denial, no ignorance, no knowledge of any created thing, no intellect, no conformity, no disbelief, no events, no other, no deviation, no polytheism, no understanding, no falsehood, no heaven, no space, no darkness, no light, no principles of what was rejected (wa-lā uṣūl li'l-mardūdāt) and no deciding on differences in the affairs of time (wa-lā fuṣūl bi-ikhtilāfi'l-awqāt).</text>

      <text>He did not add strength to His bearing witness to His oneness (waḥdāniyya) by the bearing witness of the angels. Rather, He gladdened and strengthened them when He directed them to the right course in bearing witness to Him, and when He guided them to knowledge of His oneness.</text>

This is a teaching of the Real on how to praise the Real, i.e.: 'Describe me as I should be described in exalted measure', saying: 'O Master of the Kingdom, there is no associate to You, no assistant, no helper, no companion, no partner to You in essence, no sharer in the Kingdom, no competitor in creating'.</text>

The beautifying (tajammul) of created beings is in their abasing themselves (tadhallul) before the Real.

      <text>You make the night pass into the day so that the authority of the light of unity (tawhīd) prevails and nothing remains of the traces of the lower self and its darknesses.

      <text>Among the realities of faith is friendship (muwālā) and enmity (ʿadāwā) on behalf of God. The one whom it would be best for you to renounce and turn away from among the disbelievers is your lower self. Its nature is Magian in that it says, 'Mine, from me, and through me'. God Most High said: O you who believe, fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you [9:123].</text>
      <text>Verily belief in this path (ṭarīqa) is rare and precious. Even if ordinary people who have no belief in this path were to wear themselves out with extreme asceticism and effort, they would not be among the people of Your friendship (muwālā). Like with like is more suitable.</text>
      <text>[3:28 cont'd] for whoever does that, does not belong to God in anyway - unless you protect yourselves against them, as a safeguard. God warns you of His Self: and to God is the journey's end.</text>
      <text>Companionship (ṣubḥa) with the Real (s) and nearness to Him can by no means be combined with the companionship of adversaries and being close to them.</text>
      <text>God warns you of His self: This is an address to the elect among the people of mystical knowledge (maʿrifa). As for those whose degree is less than that, He has said to them: fear the fire that" [3:131] and He said: fear a day wherein you shall be returned [2:281], and so on in other verses.</text>
      <text>It is said God warns you of His self in that you may be of the opinion that you have arrived, but surely the imperceptible affairs of the divine deception (makr) can happen to the most respected. The one who spoke for them said:</text>
      <text>I felt safe from him</text>
      <text>but the safe place granted to me was a ruse.</text>
      <text>Such it is for those</text>
      <text>who feels safe from lovers.</text>
      <text>It is said God warns you of His self because anyone who imagines that a created being can reach Him or that the feet of human aspiration can touch the carpet of might - Glory and Might be to the Absolute Oneness! And anyone who thinks that [God] has brought them near, in reality [God] has made them distant from Him.</text>

      <text>And it is said when He said, 'God warns you of His self', those hearing the address are necessarily frightened, so He said in combination with it, 'and God is kind to His servants' in order to give them reason to hope, so His way (sunna) is to evoke desire and fear in them at the same time.</text>
      <text>It is said He annihilates you in His saying 'God warns you of His self', then brings you back to life and causes you to remain in His saying 'and God is kind to His servants'.</text>

      <text>Say: 'If you love God, follow me, and God will love you, and forgive you your sins; God is Forgiving, Merciful.</text>
      <text>You love God is a separation (farq) and God loves you is a gathering (jamʿ).</text>
      <text>You love God mixed with cause (ʿilla) but God loves you without cause; rather, He is the reality itself of communion. The love of the servant for God is a state of subtle kindness (laṭīfa) he finds with respect to himself and this state brings him into conformity with His command out of pleasure (ri?ā), without any feeling of compulsion. This state necessarily involves his preferring [God] (s) over everything and everyone. The condition of love is that there can be no worldly concern (ḥaẓẓ) in any state. One who has not been entirely annihilated from his worldly concerns possesses not even a sliver of love. The love of the Real for the servant is in His desire (irāda), His beneficence (iḥsān) and His kindness (luṭf) to him. It is a desire (irāda) to bestow favor, in the sense of His (s) praise and commendation of [the servant] and in the sense of His special favor to him. Or this can be [understood as] coming from the attributes of His actions.</text>
      <text>It is said the precondition of love is your entire effacement from yourself because of your being consumed in your beloved. The one who spoke for them said:</text>
      <text>What is love</text>
      <text>until the eye is exhausted by weeping</text>
      <text>and you lose your ability to talk</text>
      <text>so that you cannot answer one who calls you.</text>
      <text>This is a difference between the beloved (al-ḥabīb) and the friend (al-khalīl). The friend [Abraham] said, 'So whoever follows me, verily belongs with me (minnī)' [14:36], and the beloved [Muhammad] said, 'follow me and God will love you'. The follower of the friend belongs with him (minhu) in the conferring of favor, while the follower of the beloved is the beloved of the Real (s) and that suffices for nearness and as a state (ḥāl).</text>
      <text>It is said that for those who submit themselves, He cuts off their longing for anything but their model and leader of the first and the last - Muhammad (ṣ).</text>
      <text>It is said there is an allusion in this verse to the fact that love is not an effect (maʿlūl) and is not brought about by obedient acts or the avoidance of evil, because He said, 'God will love you, and forgive you your sins'.</text>

      <text>When the wife of ʿImrān said, 'Lord, I have vowed to You what is within my womb as a consecration. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You Who are the Hearer, Knower. * And when she gave birth to her, she said, 'Lord, I have given birth to a female' - and God knew very well what she had given birth to the male is not as the female. 'And I have named her Mary, and commend her to You with her seed to protect them from the accursed Satan'.</text>
      <text>The one who is consecrated (muḥarrar) is someone who is not in bondage to any created being. The Real (s), in His prior decree, has emancipated such a one from the bondage of preoccupation [with anything other than the Real] in all intentions and states. When the mother of Mary made this vow and gave birth to a female, she was ashamed. When she saw her she said, 'Lord, I have given birth to a female' and she cannot be consecrated. God Most High said, 'and God knew very well what she had given birth to'. By my life, the male is not like the female in outward appearance, but when the Real (swt) accepted her every miracle appeared from her.</text>
      <text>When she said, 'I have vowed to You what is within my womb', she said, 'Accept this from me'. He granted her request, and the effects of the acceptance appeared in her and her son. One set of beings was saved by their story, and another was destroyed and experienced a trial (fitna) because of the two of them.</text>
      <text>She said, 'And I have named her Mary, and commend her to You with her seed to protect them from the accursed Satan'. She sought protection from God from there being anything in her words belonging to Satan.</text>

      <text>Her Lord accepted the child with gracious acceptance, and made her grow excellently, and Zachariah took charge of her.</text>
      <text>Inasmuch as He caused her to attain more than what her mother had wished for. It is said that [God] accepted her with a gracious acceptance (qabūl ḥasan) in His making her unique in obedience to Him, and entrusting her with that which He entrusts His friends (awliyāÌ) - so much so that everyone of her time was astonished by the excellence (ḥusn) which He entrusted to her affair even though she was a girl.</text>
      <text>It is said that the gracious acceptance was the excellence (ḥusn) of [God's] care for her in spite of His (s) knowing what would be said about Him because of her, for He is not concerned with the shamefulness of the words of enemies.</text>
      <text>I find blame in passion</text>
      <text>for you delicious.</text>
      <text>Out of love of hearing you mentioned,</text>
      <text>let them blame me.</text>
      <text>Just as it is said:</text>
      <text>Let anyone</text>
      <text>who wishes</text>
      <text>say what he wishes.</text>
      <text>I don't care!</text>
      <text>It is also said that the gracious acceptance was His causing her to grow in the quality of protection (ʿiṣma) until she said: I seek refuge in the Merciful from you if you fear God [19:18].</text>
      <text>And made her grow excellently until she stood straight in obedience and preferred His (s) good pleasure in every moment, and until the fruit from her was such a one as Jesus (ʿa). This was the excellent growth. Zachariah took charge of her and it was part of the gracious acceptance and excellent growth that he made such a one as Zachariah (ʿa) among the prophets her guardian, and the caretaker and protector of her affairs. God revealed to David (ʿa), 'If you see someone seeking me, become a servant to him'.</text>
      <text>[3:37 cont'd] Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary, where she was, he found her with provisions. 'O Mary', he said,'Whence comes this to you?' She said, 'From God. Truly God provides for whomever He will without reckoning'.</text>
      <text>One of the signs of the gracious acceptance was that she could never be found anywhere except in the sanctuary (miḥrāb). Whoever dwells and stays where He is worshipped, that is where the sanctuary is and that is a rare and precious servant.</text>

      <text>i.e., when he saw the special gift (karāma) of God (s) with her, he grew more and more certain, and more and more hopeful, so he asked for a son in spite of his advanced age. The granting of his request was a rupture of ordinary reality (naq? al-āda).</text>
      <text>It is said that Zachariah (ʿa) asked for a son to be a help to him in obedience, and an heir from his progeny in prophethood, so that he might uphold the right of God (ḥaqq Allāh). So it was a request which deserved to be granted. When a request is for the right of the Real (ḥaqq al-ḥaqq) and not for the pleasure of the self (ḥaẓẓ al-nafs) He will not refuse it. Zachariah (ʿa) saw Mary with summer fruits in the winter and winter fruits in the summer, so he asked for a son in his old age so that it might be a sign (āya) and a miracle (muʿjiza).</text>

      <text>And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary at worship</text>
      <text>When the petitioner asks and stays at the door, the request is granted to him. In this is an allusion to the fact that anyone who needs something from kings should stay at the door until the request is granted.</text>

      <text>[3:39 cont'd] that 'God gives you good tidings of John, who shall confirm a Word from God; a lord, and one chaste, and a prophet of the righteous'.</text>
      <text>It is said he named him John (yaḥyā) because of the life (ḥayāt) of his heart through God. Exegesis tells us that the barrenness of his mother [returned to] life through him.</text>
      <text>It is said that [he was named John] because the cause of life for anyone who believes in Him is through his heart.</text>
      <text>His saying 'who shall confirm a Word from God (Allāh)' means his confirmation of the word Allāh by which he worshipped Him, or that he was brought into being (mukawwan) by the Word of God.</text>
      <text>His saying 'a lord': The lord is one who is not in bondage to any created thing. He has been freed (taḥarrara) from captivity to his whim and from every created thing. It is said the lord is someone who has actualized his servanthood to [God] (s). It is said the lord is the one who is superior to the people of his age, and John was such.</text>
      <text>It is said lord because he did not seek any station for himself, nor did he view himself as having any worth. When he dedicated himself in humility to God in every way, He caused him to rise above the group and made him a lord to all.</text>
      <text>His saying 'and one chaste', i.e., liberated from passions and spared from carnal human properties despite being human. It is said [it means] being protected from the demands of his lower self, restraining from that by engaging in exaltation and seeking to draw near. It is said the uprootings (istiÌṣālāt) coming to him through the intuitions of realities prevented him from holding on to any preference for a worldly concern.</text>

The point of repeating the mention of being chosen is firstly, He has chosen you through special gifts, position, and an exalted state; and secondly, He has chosen you to bear Jesus (ʿa.) without a father, and no woman can ever be compared to you until the Day of Resurrection.

      <text>She was not given good tidings about her portion in this world, nor fortunes in the Hereafter. Rather, she was given good tidings of what had been established in [the birth of Jesus] in a weighty sign, and his being a prophet of God, a confirmation of the miracle.</text>
      <text>It is said He informed her that whoever falls into the overwhelming divine deliberate power and ends up before His decree will encounter miracles of that power which no one has experienced. Indeed, Mary lived for a long time with a excellent reputation and recognized chastity. Then He confused the outward appearance of this state with what people viewed as a blameworthy event. But in actuality it was not as the foolish, whose eyes were drunken from witnessing the course of the divine determination, thought.</text>

      <text>Truly the likeness of Jesus in God's sight, is as Adam's likeness"</text>
      <text>He chose both of them to be purified of the spirit (rūḥ) from passing from one body to another (tanāsukh) in the loins. He singled out Adam in creating him by His own hand, and Jesus (ʿa) in selecting the blowing of the spirit into him as a form of honor. Even though these two were weighty beings, the imperfection of events and creatureliness were nonetheless unavoidable for them:... then He said to him, 'Be', and he was [3:59].</text>

      <text>The truth is from your Lord"</text>
      <text>The truth (al-ḥaqq) is from your Lord, O Muhammad, so have absolutely no doubt that there is no one who resembles Him (s) in causing existence. No created thing has any power over the establishment of His way. The existence of things that exist has been conferred from the hiddenness of nonexistence - their beginning is from God and to Him is their return.</text>

      <text>And whoever disputes with you concerning him"</text>
      <text>It means that after you have revealed the truth of that which was said to you, and the knowledge of that which We spoke to you has been confirmed as true in your heart, do not be reticent in imposing the mutual cursing. Trust that you have the force (qahr) and help (nuṣra), and that We are guarding over you and have sheltered you in the wing of Our nearness. If they had sought this mutual cursing, the wadis would have burned them as raging fires, but God (s) gave them respite because of His knowledge of the believers [to come] in their loins.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this verse is to one whose state has descended from the states of the sincere. When the lights [of the sincere] appear, what remains of the others fades away without a trace.</text>

      <text>'O People of the Scripture! Come now to a word agreed upon between us and you,</text>
      <text>It is the word of divine unity (tawḥīd) and bearing witness in singling out the Real (s) alone in creating things.</text>
      <text>[3:64 cont'd] that we worship none but God...</text>
      <text>Do not look in your innermost self (sirr) to any created thing. There should be no object of worship for you other than Him. There should be no aim or object of witnessing other than Him. This is the protection against polytheism (shirk). You yourself are foremost among the 'others' that should not be witnessed.</text>
      <text>[3:64 cont'd]...and do not take each other for lords, beside God...</text>
      <text>The sincerity in this is made manifest in abandoning praise and blame of ['others'], removing complaining or doubt about them, and cleansing the innermost self from taking into account so much as a speck of erasure (maḥw) or affirmation (ithbāt) as coming from them. He (ṣ) said: The truest verse the Arabs sung was Labid:</text>
      <text>Isn't everything</text>
      <text>other than God unreal (bāṭil) ?</text>

      <text>The ḥanīf is the one who stands straight (mustaqīm) on the right way. The aḥnaf is one who is mustaqīm with bow legs - the one who leans with his feet in this way is called mustaqīm for good luck. Abraham (ʿa) was a ḥanīf, not bending from the truth and not swerving from the law, and not zigzagging according to anything in which there is a share belonging to the soul. He surrendered his wealth, his soul, his son, and everything altogether to the ruling (ḥukm) of God and to waiting for His command.</text>

      <text>And God is the Protector (walī) of the believers because they have been entrusted with His religion and they conform to His unity. The friendship (walāya) of God can only be through aid (ʿawn), help (nuṣra), selection (takhṣīṣ) and nearness (qurba).</text>

Can this be anything other than the divine judgment of forsakenness and the decree of exclusion? Then He informed them that among them are those who were hypocritical regarding their situation.

      <text>He singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding'.</text>
      <text>He singles out whom He will with all kinds of blessings by His mercy. The 'mercy', according to this [way of reading the phrase], is a cause for the designation of whomever He wishes for the blessing. There is definitely an elision [in this phrase], for it is possible that in [the phrase] He singles out His mercy for whom He will, 'mercy' does not function as the cause. The 'mercy' according to this interpretation would mean prophecy and friendship (walāya). And it would mean protection (ʿisma) and anything from all the portions of good deeds by which He singles out a particular servant. This would be included in His words: He singles out for His mercy, i.e. for His blessing.</text>
      <text>He singles out some people for the blessings of moral traits, some for the blessing of provisions, some for the blessing of servanthood, others for the blessing of spiritual desire (irāda), others for success in external things, others with the gift of an easier life, and others for encountering secrets. He said: And if you were to count God's blessing, you could never reckon it [14:34, 16:38].</text>
      <text>It is said when they heard: He singles out whom He will for His mercy, they knew that it has nothing to do with any means of attainment. Rather, the command comes by origination (ibtidāÌ) and divine will (mashīÌa).</text>
      <text>Is it said He singles out whom He will for His mercy in comprehending what He reveals of the secrets to him and what He gives to him in different types of information.</text>

      <text>He informs us that they, in spite of their error and disbelief, are different in their moral qualities. All of them are unfaithful to the religion (dīn), but among them are those who return to proper (human) interactions. Even though they interact with sincerity, it will not benefit them in the granting of the reward, but it will benefit them in lessening the punishment since disbelievers are held accountable in the details of the laws. If, in their disbelief they sinned less, they will suffer less punishment than those who have lost the most, even though their punishment will also be eternal.</text>
      <text>Then He explained that the judgment is not theirs, so that when they say, 'We have no duty towards the Gentiles' [3:75] this situation is not as they believe, nor do these words benefit them. Rather, the judgment belongs to God (s).</text>

Because they chose the seeking of pleasure in the present, they have lost in the two abodes. They remain apart from the Real. What they sought in pleasure in worldly portion (ḥaẓẓ) brought together all kinds of tribulations upon them, but they were not aware of what hit them: God shall not speak to them, nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them.

      <text>The allusion in this verse is to those who are false in their claims on this path (ṭarīqa). They embellish what they say and let loose their tongues concerning that about which their hearts have no information or verification, deceiving the foolish, ordinary people and novices. They imagine that they have verification of what they say. In describing them, God Most High said: so that you might suppose it is as part of the Book; yet it is not part of the Book. Likewise, the lords of deception and fraud direct their talk to the weak. As for the people of realities, their secrets are unveiled before them.</text>
      <text>God Most High said: and they speak falsehood against God, while they know, i.e., they know that they are speaking falsely.

      <text>It belongs not to any mortal that God should given him the Book, the Judgment, prophethood, then that he should say to men, 'Be servants to me instead of God'. Rather, 'Be masters, by virtue of what you know of the Book and in what you study'.</text>
      <text>i.e., it is not a quality of anyone whom We have chosen him for prophethood or selected him for friendship (walāya) to call created beings to himself or teach anything affirming himself or his worldly fortune, because His (s) choosing them for prophethood includes protecting them from what is not permissible. To allow that as an attribute of theirs would be incompatible with their state. Rather, the messengers and the friends call created beings to God (swt). It is the meaning of God Most High's words: Rather, 'Be masters' [3:79], i.e., He commands them to be masters to created beings. 'Those who have special knowledge of the Lord' (rabbānī) is related to [the word] 'lord' or 'master' (rabb) just it is said, 'So and so is "bull-necked" (raqabānī) or "full of life" (ḥayyānī)' and the like. They are those who have knowledge of God, who are gentle in God, standing firm through God in their annihilation from anything other than God. Their worldly fortunes consumed, they are immersed in the realities of His existence rather than their sensory perception through their own states. They speak, hear, and see by means of God, and so they are effaced from what is other than God.</text>
      <text>It is said the master (rabbānī) is one who has had the shadow of his lower self (nafs) lifted from him and he lives in the shelter of His (s) shadow.</text>
      <text>It is said the master is he who does not affirm anyone other than his Lord as one, and does not bear witness to even an atom of effacement or affirmation as belonging to other than Him or coming from other than Him.</text>
      <text>It is said the master is he who is verified in His (s) existence and effaced in witnessing Him, so the One who stands in for him is other than him and the One who acts on his account is other than him.</text>

      <text>Surely those who disbelieve after they have believed, and then increase in unbelief, their repentance shall not be accepted; those are the ones who go astray.</text>
      <text>The allusion in it is that those who return to the states of the people of habit after having traveled the way of desire (ṭarīq al-irāda). They preferred this world and following caprice (hawāÌ) over seeking the Real (swt), so they renounced the people of the path and became more and more lonely in their darknesses. Their repentance shall not be accepted; those are the ones who go astray [3:90] from the path of the Real and their faith shall not be accepted after the appearance of faithlessness. Their punishment is that, as the days pass, the estrangement of the heart from the path only increases for them, and they are not distressed by the clarity of state which has slipped away from them. If they had persevered, their repentance would have been accepted, but the Real (s) follows His way (sunna) with those who are listless on this path when they revert to habitual states (aḥwāl al-ʿāda), not feeling regret for the moments that have passed away from them. God Most High said: And We shall confound their hearts and eyes; just as they did not believe in it the first time [6:110]. The apostate from Islam is a more powerful enemy to Muslims than the regular disbeliever.

      <text>You will not attain piety (birr) until you expend of what you love; and whatever thing you expend, God knows of it.</text>
      <text>When it is piety that is sought, He has mentioned [the word] 'of' (min) regarding it, and it is [the particle of speech] for dividing into portions, and so He said: of what you love. Whoever desires piety (birr) should expend some portion of what he loves, while whoever desires the One who is All-Benign (al-bārr) should expend everything he loves. Whoever expends of what he loves in this world will find what he seeks from the Real, Most High. Whoever is attached to the fortunes (ḥuẓūẓ) of the lower self (nafs) will not find fortune in nearness to his Lord.</text>
      <text>It is said you will only attain piety by expending what you love. When you come to the One who is All-Benign (al-bārr) you will prefer him over your fortunes.</text>
      <text>And whatever thing you expend, God knows of it. There are those who expend looking for reward and compensation, those who expend looking to defend themselves from affliction and tribulations, and those who expend content with His knowing. One of them said:</text>
      <text>He wishes to walk in a weak way</text>
      <text>so that she might,</text>
      <text>when she hears of his suffering,</text>
      <text>send a message to him.</text>
      <text>He trembles because of what has become known</text>
      <text>in seeking the sublime,</text>
      <text>that his qualities might be mentioned</text>

      <text>All food was lawful to the Children of Israel save what Israel forbade for himself before the Torah was revealed. Say: 'Bring the Torah now, and recite it, if you are truthful'. * Whoever invents falsehood against God after that, those are the evildoers.</text>
      <text>The original state of things is that He does not declare them permissible or prohibited so there is no ordinance regarding them. That is a liberality and kindness from the Real (s) until the point when a command or a law comes regarding it. Surely God (s) eased the decrees of religious obligation for the people of the end (ahl al-nihāya). Their way is to adopt what is easiest in order to perfect what comes to them from the decrees of the hearts, and surely that which is upon their hearts in difficulties is harder on them. As for the people of the beginning (ahl al-bidāya), the affair is constrained for them in tasks and litanies, so their way is to adopt what is harder and more difficult so as to empty their hearts of notions. Whoever thinks otherwise is in error.</text>
      <text>The allusion as well in this verse in His saying: Whoever invents falsehood against God is to the states of the people of false claims and errors. They absolve themselves and attribute to God (s) their false notions (hawājis) but God is free of these. It is a rare servant who can distinguish between [good] incoming thoughts (khawāṭir) and false notions (hawājis).</text>

      <text>The first house established for the people was that at Bakka, a blessed place, and a guidance to all worlds. * Therein are clear signs, the station of Abraham; and whoever enters it is in security. It is the duty of people towards God to make the pilgrimage to the House, if he is able to make his way there. As for the one who disbelieves, God is Independent of all worlds.</text>
      <text>The House is a stone and the worshiper is a clod of earth. The clod of earth has become connected to the stone, so the clay is with the stone and the One Who has always been (man lam yazal) is magnified and sanctified.</text>
      <text>It is said the House is the object of circumambulation of the lower selves (nufūs) while the Real (s) is the object sought by hearts.</text>
      <text>The House is remains and vestiges, which are only tracings and stones but</text>
      <text>These traces of ours</text>
      <text>point to us.</text>
      <text>So after we [are gone]</text>
      <text>look to the traces.</text>
      <text>It is said the House is stone but not all stone is alike. It is stone but for the hearts of the lovers it is a source of restlessness, and for the souls of the poor (fuqarāÌ) it is something to boast about. Indeed for the hearts of some people it is cooling and pleasant and for the hearts of others it is agitating and elevating.</text>
      <text>They are of different types [in what they see in the House]:</text>
      <text>A house that is the place sought and visited by lovers. Before it one hears reports of them and witnesses their traces. A house - whoever looks to it with the eye of separation (tafriqa), returns with a ruined innermost self (sirr). Whoever observes it with the eye of connection (i?āfa) wins every approach (taqrīb) and affirmation (ījāb). As it is said:</text>
      <text>Truly houses,</text>
      <text>even when they are silent,</text>
      <text>have a pact with Our lovers</text>
      <text>since they stop at them.</text>
      <text>A house - whoever visits it with his lower self (nafs) finds His kindnesses (alṭāf), and whoever visits it with his heart (qalb) finds His unveilings (kushūfāt).</text>
      <text>It is said He said: and purify My House [2:125 and 22:26], attributing it to Himself. But here He said the first house established for the people, and in this is a bit of an allusion to the source of gathering together (ʿayn al-jamʿ).</text>

      <text>How can you disbelieve while you have God's verses recited to you, and His Messenger is in your midst? Whoever holds fast to God, he is guided to a straight path.</text>
      <text>The shade of disbelief should not fall over one in whose heart the suns of mystical knowledge (ʿirfān) have risen, for surely when day comes, night slips away.</text>
      <text>Whoever holds fast to God: The one who holds fast to God has only found the holding fast from God. How could those who have not been guided by God hold fast to God? The guidance from Him in the beginning causes your holding fast in the end. Your holding fast does not cause the guidance. The true state of affairs of the holding fast is sincerity in taking refuge in Him, persevering in the flight to Him, and holding on to the act of appealing for His help. Whoever has the covering of separation (tafriqa) removed from his innermost self realizes that there is not an atom that belongs to anything other than God and from it a sīna. The people who hold fast to Him are those who are held fast by Him. The master of the first and the last (ṣ) said: I seek refuge in You from You.</text>
      <text>Whoever holds fast in his soul without being effaced from his strength and power in his holding, polytheism (shirk) is his homeland but he does not notice.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, fear God as He should be feared (ḥaqqa tuqātihi)</text>
      <text>The rightful due (ḥaqq) in God-fearing (taqwa) is that which conforms to the command, neither increased nor decreased by one's own ability. This is something that has been confirmed by statements regarding it. His command (amr) has two aspects, one of irreversible decree (ḥatm) and one of invitation (nadb). Likewise, what is said regarding prohibition (nahy) has two parts, forbidding (taḥrīm) and abstaining (tanzīh). Included in all this is that the rightful due of fearing Him is firstly avoiding error, then avoiding negligence, then guarding (tuqāt) against every want, then cleansing every defect. When you have guarded against witnessing your fear of God (taqwa), after your having taking it on as a characteristic, then fear the rightful due (ḥaqq) of your fearing God (taqwa). The rightful due (ḥaqq) of fearing God (taqwa) is the rejection of disobedience and the removal of forgetfulness, the sustaining of contracts, the preservation of limits, the witnessing of the Deity, stripping off the mortal human properties (aḥkām al-bashariyya) and being extinguished under the flow of the decree (ḥukm) after avoiding every sin and injustice, and to feel disdain in seeking to gain access to Him by any bit of your obedience, disregarding the dispensing of His generosity, and realizing that He does not accept anyone for cause (ʿilla), nor does He reject anyone for cause.</text>
      <text>[3:102 cont'd] and do not die, except as Muslims.</text>

      <text>And hold fast to God's bond, together, and do not scatter; remember God's grace upon you when you were enemies, and He brought your hearts together so that by His grace you became brothers; and you were upon the brink of a pit of fire; but He delivered you from it. So God makes clear to you His signs that you might be guided.</text>
      <text>The holding fast to His bond (s) is clinging to the traces of the intermediary (wāsiṭa) - the noble one (ʿazīz) (ṣ) and this is by actualizing and staying connected to the Book and the Sunna.</text>
      <text>It is rightly said that the elite (khawāṣṣ) are those spoken of in [the words] and hold fast to God's bond, while it is said of the elect of the elect (khāṣṣ al-khāṣṣ) 'and hold fast to God'. Whoever turns back from the presence of His signs (sawāniḥ) to his own choice and device, his own cognition and reasoning, his own knowledge and kind; and takes refuge in the shade of his own planning, seeking illumination by the light of his own intellect and cognition - he has the shade of divine solicitude (ʿināya) taken away from him and is left to his unfortunate state.</text>
      <text>And do not scatter: Scattering or separation (tafriqa) is the most intense punishment, and it is the consort of polytheism (shirk).</text>
      <text>And remember God's grace upon you when you were enemies: They were enemies when they remained with their worldly concerns, turning towards the narrowness of mortal human nature, and competing with one another as befits the stinginess of lower selves.</text>
      <text>And He brought your hearts together in deliverance from the captivity of engendered things (mukawwanāt) and drove back the dangers from their innermost selves. Then what they sought became one thing together. If a thousand people were to be brought together in one pursuit, they would, in truth, be one.</text>
      <text>So that by his grace you became brothers: His grace, which is His protection of you as brothers in agreement in aim and aspiration, annihilated from the worldly concerns of the lower self and hidden to stinginess and avarice.</text>
      <text>And you were upon the brink of a pit of fire by your being held captive to the objects of your desire and bound by the shackles of your worldly concerns and whims.</text>
      <text>But He delivered you from it by the light of contentment and being extinguished in the flow of the decree, and this, in truth, is a mighty position and a weighty rank. Included in all this is abandoning reliance on what is from your own virtues and piety, or the intellect, discernment, learning, and understanding; and fleeing to God, may He be glorified and exalted above everything other than Him.</text>

      <text>This is an allusion to people who remain with God, for God. No blame of any blamer reaches them, and no reliance on any cause (ʿilla) cuts them off from God. Their group comprehends the proofs of His command. They have restrained their lower selves and have dedicated their lives in seeking to obtain His contentment. They work for God, have been faithful to the religion (dīn) of God, and call the created beings of God to God. So their commerce is profitable and their transaction is not a loss.</text>

      <text>Because Muṣtafa (ṣ) is the most honored of the prophets, his community is the best of communities. Because they are the best of communities, they are the most honored of communities. Because they are the most honored of communities, they are the most desiring (ashwāq) of communities. Because they are the most desiring of communities, their lives are the shortest of lives. He created them as the last of created beings so that their sojourn on the earth would not be long. Their goodness has been obtained not by the abundance of their prayers and devotional acts, but by the increase in His drawing them near and selecting them. Surely the standing of the earlier ones at the door has been long, but when the permission comes to enter, the later ones will go first.</text>

      <text>Enjoining decency, and forbidding indecency: Decency is service to the Real and indecency is keeping company with the lower self (nafs). Decency is to prefer what is due to the Real (ḥaqq al-ḥaqq) and indecency is to choose the worldly portion of the lower self. Decency is what brings you close to Him and indecency is what veils you from Him. What is binding in the command to decency is that you be characterized by decency and what is required in forbidding indecency is to be adverse to indecency.</text>

      <text>The tranquility sent by the Real (s) to the heart of Muṣṭafā (ṣ) was from God (s), without intermediary, while the strengthening of the hearts of the believers was through the Messenger (ṣ). If not for what remained in them, he would not have replied to them, telling of the help in sending the angel (malak). Why tell of the angel when the affair is entirely in the hand of the King (malik)?</text>

      <text>God (s) enacts His practice (sunna) with His friends is such a way that, when their intentions become weak, their spiritual desire (irāda) low, or their hearts are on the verge of some listlessness; He shows them kindnesses and all kinds of special gifts (karāmāt) which strengthen the means for obtaining their mystical knowledge (irfān) and reinforce the realities of their certainty. According to this practice, He sent down this address, and then separated their hearts and innermost selves from anything other than Him entirely, and He said: Victory comes only from God.</text>

      <text>No part of the command is yours [Muḥammad], whether He relents to them or chastises them; for they are indeed evildoers. * To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He wills and chastises whom He wills. And God is Forgiving, Merciful.</text>
      <text>The Deity is the One to Whom belongs the command and prohibition. Because there no counterpart to him in divinity, [the Prophet] (ṣ) has no part in the command and prohibition.</text>
      <text>It is said that in what He taught him and told him, He divested [the Prophet] of everything else and every share or claim since He stated that no part of the command was his. If no part of the command is permitted for the lord of the first and the last, then how can there be any part of the command for the one whose rank is lower in station?</text>
      <text>It is said He takes for Himself alone the secret of His servants in His decree, so He said: 'I am the One Who relents to whom I will among My servants and I punish whom I will. What happens in the end is hidden from you, O Muḥammad, and you are not aware of My secret regarding them'.</text>
      <text>It is said He raised [the Prophet] up in one moment to a station in which He said: and you threw not when you threw, but God threw [8:17]. [The Prophet] threw a handful of earth and hit all the faces. But in another moment He said to him: No part of the command is yours [3:128], then added in explanation: To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth [3:129]. Therefore the right of possession is His right of possession, the command is His command, and the decree is His decree. He punishes whom He wills and brings closer whom He wills. He guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills.</text>

      <text>He linked obedience to the Messenger (ṣ) to obedience to Himself. This was to honor [the Prophet's] worth, and to make things easier for the community by restoring them to the company of an individual from amongst themselves. Surely, being with one's own kind is more reassuring.</text>

      <text>And vie with one another hastening to forgiveness from your Lord, and to a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth that has been prepared for those who fear. * Who expend in prosperity and adversity, and restrain their rage, and pardon their fellow-men; and God loves those who are virtuous.</text>
      <text>The meaning here is 'vie one another in acting in ways that will bring about forgiveness for you'. Hearts were tormented, imagining that that was a difficult matter, so [the Prophet] (ṣ) said: Remorse is repentance. Repentance brings about forgiveness because the one who disobeys is the one who is in need of forgiveness.</text>
      <text>The people who vie with one another are of several types. Those who are worshippers vie with one another by their feet in acts of obedience. Those who have mystical knowledge (ʿārifūn) vie one another by their aspirations in acts of drawing near. Those who are disobedient vie one another by their remorse in choking on their grief. Whoever vies with others by his feet [in acts of obedience] finds His recompense. Whoever vies with others by his aspirations finds His nearness. Whoever vies with others by his remorse finds His mercy.</text>
      <text>When He mentioned the garden, He described it by the vastness of its width, and in that there is information about its height because the height is comparable to the width. But when He mentioned forgiveness, he did not mention height or width, so some people have said that forgiveness is from the qualities of the Essence and is part of the meaning of mercy. According to this (way of thinking), His forgiveness is His decision (ḥukm) in passing over [the punishment] of the servant. It is His Speech (kalām), and the quality of the Essence is too holy for size and width. [On the other hand], those who say His forgiveness belongs with the Attributes of His acting say that because of the abundance of sins, He did not describe ultimate forgiveness, which would indicate His inclusion of all sins.</text>
      <text>Who expend in prosperity and adversity: They do not hoard anything from God and prefer Him to all things. They expend their bodies in acts of obedience and all kinds of litanies and effort; their wealth in the spreading of good things and striving for acts of drawing near by different kinds of alms; their hearts in seeking and then continual observation; their spirits according to the purity of their objects of love and the fulfillment of the totality of states; and their innermost selves in witnessings in all moments, waiting for allusions to the things sought, exerting their utmost in hastening to the subtlety of things sought.</text>

      <text>And who when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember God, and pray forgiveness for their sins - and who shall forgive sins but God? - and who do not persist in what they did, knowing. * Those - their requital is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein; excellent is the wage of those workers!</text>
      <text>God Most High revealed to Moses (ʿa): Say to those who do wrong, 'Until such time as they do not remember Me, I have obliged Myself to remember those who remember Me and My remembrance of those who do wrong is the curse'. But He said to those who do wrong in this community: or wrong themselves, remember God, then He says in the last part of the verse: and who shall forgive sins but God?</text>
      <text>It is said one's indecency is according to one's state and station, as is true of one's wrong doing. The transgressions that occur in the minds of the most respected people are like their being acted out by others. Their speaker said:</text>

      <text>The crime (jurm) on the carpet is not like the sin (dhanb) at the door.</text>
      <text>It is said they commit an indecency by relying on their (own) actions, or they wrong themselves by regarding their states, so they seek forgiveness for their sins by declaring themselves free from their [own] movements and lack of movements, knowing from them that there is no means to Him except by Him. He has purified them of the wrong doings of their selves. Looking to states and actions when realities appear is wrong doing. One whom God has purified by the light of solicitude is protected from entanglement in the delusions of mankind.</text>
      <text>Those - their requital is forgiveness from their Lord in returning them to witnessing the Lordship and what was already theirs in the best possible outcome and fate.</text>

      <text>The messengers were stationed (mawfūqūn) where they were stationed, and they spoke of what they have been taught according to what they knew.

      <text>Why, if he should die or is slain, will you turn back on your heels: When Muṣṭafā (ṣ) passed away, the eyes of discernment of all went weak, except those of al-Ṣadīq (ra). God aided him with the power of the Spirit of Peace (sakīna) and inspired him with the power of governorship (al-tawallā). [Abū Bakr] said, 'Whoever worships Muhammad, Muhammad has died'. All were subdued by the authority of his words because of what spread to them from the light of his state, just as the sun by its rising incorporates in its rays the lights of the stars. The capacities of the places where the rays of each star fall are then concealed within [the sun's rays].</text>

      <text>God has been true to His promise, when you slew them by His leave, until you lost heart, and quarreled over the command; and you disobeyed after he had shown you what you longed for.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this verse is to the fact that the Real (al-ḥaqq) raises His friends up (aqāma) in the truth of His truth (ḥaqq ḥaqqihi) and restrains them from attaining their worldly fortunes (ḥuẓūẓ). He (s) stands (qāma) as sufficient for them in every way. Whoever persists in the path of uprightness (istiqāma) will not deviate from His boundary, and He will not deviate from His pact, for God has been true to his promise to them with beautiful and continuous sufficiency. But whoever falls away from uprightness - even if only a step - stumbles in his walking, and his state and ability is destabilized to the extent of his offence. So whoever has been increased has been increased from Him, and whoever suffers decrease has suffered decrease from Him.</text>
      <text>[3:152 cont'd] Some of you desired this world; and some of you desired the Hereafter. Then He turned you away from them, so that He might try you; yet now He has pardoned you, and God is Bounteous to the believers.</text>
      <text>The value of each person is his desire (irāda). So whoever's aspiration is for this world, his value is base and paltry like this world. Whoever's aspiration is for the Hereafter, his rank is a noble one. Whoever's aspiration is knowledge of the Lord (rabbāniyya), he is the master (sayyid) of his time.</text>
      <text>It is said that anyone who is purified of his desire reaches Him, and anyone who reaches Him draws near - by His kindness - to Him and is brought close in the locus of intimate friendship (khuṣūṣiyya) in His presence.</text>
      <text>Then He turned you away from them: The allusion in it is that He has turned some people away from Him and distracted them from Himself by what is other than Him. Others He turned from anything other, singling them out for Himself. He turned the ascetics away from this world, the worshippers from following whims, the aspirants (murīdūn) from lower desires (al-munā), and those who declare oneness from everything other [than Him].</text>

Say: 'The affair belongs entirely to God'. They conceal within their hearts what they do not disclose to you, saying, 'Had we had any part in the affair, we would not have been slain here'. Say: 'Even if you had been in your houses, those for whom it had been appointed that they be slain would have sallied forth to the places where they were to lie' that God might try what was in your breasts and that He might prove what was in your hearts; and God knows what is in the breasts.</text>
      <text>The allusion in this verse is to people for whom a period of weakness occurs. The calls of the Real (s) come from within and without, so that it is as if the rocks in the streets and the bricks in the walls are crying out to such a one, 'Don't do it, O servant of God!' But he is resolved upon his crooked way and settled in his error, refusing to acknowledge what he knows is more fitting and appropriate in his state. If he were to accomplish his wish and fulfill his aspiration, he would undoubtedly rein himself in and would hold back from galloping ahead, for he will obtain nothing but gasping breaths and continuous sorrows. The Real (s) has caused him to inherit only estrangement. Eventually, when he has been in this place of regret for a long time, the Real (s) will relieve him with His beautiful kindness and draw him near with His gracious affection. He will deliver him from the narrowness of his captivity and transfer him to the spaciousness of His pardon and favor. Many of these will reach the place of the most respected, and then they will stand by God for God when they have passed from the station and honor.</text>

      <text>And if you die or are slain, it is to God you shall be mustered: When the destination is to God, the journey is pleasant. A journey such as this, when it comes to an end, is sweeter than honey because of its hardships!</text>

      <text>It was by the mercy of God that you were lenient with them; had you been harsh and fierce of heart, they would have dispersed from about you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the matter. And when you are resolved, rely on God; for God loves those who rely.</text>
      <text>He stripped [the Prophet] of his human attributes (awṣāf al-bashariyya), singling him out to be clothed from the attribute of lordship (naʿt al-rubūbiyya). He said that what shone upon him was from the lights of divine governorship (tawallā), not from the effects of meeting or encountering. If not for the fact that He had selected him for what He clothed him in, how could he have that quality?!</text>
      <text>It is said that among the particular properties of His (s) mercy for [the Prophet] was that He gave him strength so that he kept company with them and had patience in conveying the message to them, despite what he used to bear in their disagreeing with the authority with which he was utterly engaged at every moment from the overwhelming power of the Real over him. If not for the divine strength the Real chose for him alone, how could he have had the power to keep company with them? When Moses (ʿa) was close to the covenant of hearing His word, don't you see how he was unable to remain patient in speaking with his brother, so he grabbed his head, pulling it toward him?</text>
      <text>It is said if it were not for the fact that [the Prophet] (ṣ) saw them effaced in what came to them from the decrees of turning about (taṣrīf) and his realization that the originator of these [shifting events] was God, he would not have been able to keep company with them.</text>
      <text>Had you been harsh and fierce of heart, they would have dispersed from about you: If you had given them to drink the pure drink of unity (tawḥīd), undiluted with their worldly concerns, they would have separated from you, wandering about, unable to stand still for even a moment. So pardon them for what may be their neglecting of your right and the respect due to you, and for what you come across in them in their negligence in serving Us and obeying Us.</text>

      <text>If God helps you, then none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, then who is there who can help you after Him? Therefore on God let the believers rely.</text>
      <text>His help to the believers is by granting success to the bodily forms (ashbāḥ), and then by granting realization to the spirits (arwāḥ).</text>
      <text>It is said God helps you by supporting the outward aspects of things (ẓawāhir) and by guiding the innermost hearts (sarāÌir).</text>
      <text>It is said the help will only be against the enemy and the worst enemy you have is the lower self (nafs) between your two sides. The help against the lower self is that its claims of strength will be routed by the guardians of His mercy until the armies of cravings scatter upon the attacks of the assemblies of combatants. The friendship of God will remain, purified from the doubts of the pretensions which are the qualities of being human, and the cravings and desires of the souls which are the effects of veiling and obstacles of separation.</text>
      <text>If He forsakes you: The forsaking is the abandonment of those who are disobedient, for those whom He helps He holds back from pursing the objectionable and those whom He forsakes He gives free rein and entrusts them to the evil of their free choice. Such a one's state comes apart in the torrents of cravings, so he wanders one way without shame and than another way without respect. Surely, when the Real releases someone and does not take him by the hand, and deserts him, there is no protector for him.</text>
      <text>Therefore on God let believers rely in finding security with the sincerity of supplication and lowering the garment of pardon over the defects of sin by the purity of seeking refuge and disclaiming any strength or power.</text>
      <text>It is said in the event of [His] help He said then none can overcome you. However, in the event of being forsaken, He did not say 'then there is no helper for you' but rather said by way of hint and reply then who is there who can help you after Him?. There is a subtlety here with respect to the niceties of the properties of speech.</text>

      <text>It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent; whoever defrauds shall bring what he has defrauded on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.</text>
      <text>He has made the states of the prophets free of the stain of treacherous actions. Those to whom We gave the message to bear to Our servants convey it to those who should receive it. They are not troubled with the matter of any close friend without Our command and they do not hold back in conveying the share of anyone when We have commanded it, harboring malice. Don't you see how [the Prophet] said of Abū Ṭālib, 'Go and bury him' when the Commander of the Believers ʿAlī (ra) said to him, 'Your erring uncle has died'. And how could he have accepted banishment for the killer of Ḥamza when he became a Muslim?</text>
      <text>It is said it was not for any prophet (ṣ) to give Our secrets to any but the people to whom they were meant. Rather, to each was revealed what they were meant to hear. Thus, in the tradition: We were commanded to reveal (yunzil) to the people [according to] their stations (manāzil).</text>

      <text>He gave goodness to them in abundance and favored them with generous blessings, for He sent someone like Muṣṭafā, the lord of mankind (ṣ) to them. [The Prophet] taught them their religion (dīn) and made their proofs clear to them. He belonged to them in every way but they were not grateful for his blessings, did not respect his right, and were not able to see what he guided them to, nor refrain from straying in error. This is a description of his enemies who rejected and were arrogant. As for the believers, they assumed the grace in the choice. They received the command in hearing and obeying to the utmost degree so they were happy in this world and the Hereafter and became deserving of generosity and nearness from God.</text>

      <text>[The word] 'to respond' (istijāba) has an advantage and superiority over [the word] 'to answer' (ijāba) by way of allusion, not from the Arabic. It is that they respond willingly, not under compulsion. They respond to God without it entailing the bearing of a difficulty. Rather, [they respond] by the directive of the heart (qalb), the love of the heart (fuÌād), the free choice of the spirit and finding delight in bearing [God's] decree (ḥukm). So the response to the Real is through His existence (wujūd) and the response to the Messenger (ʿa) is through taking on character traits (takhalluq) as prescribed from His limits (hudūd). The response of the Real is through realization in the clarity (ṣafā') of the truth of Lordship (rubūbiyya) and the response of the Messenger (ʿa) is through fidelity (wafāÌ) in upholding servanthood (ʿubūdiyya).</text>
      <text>After the wounds had afflicted them: In the beginning of their transactions before the appearance of the lights of disclosure (tajallā) to their hearts and the smiling of the realities in their innermost hearts.</text>
      <text>Those who did good among them: Doing good is that you worship God as if you see Him - and this is [your] becoming a witness (mushāhada) and God-fearing - for if you do not see Him, He sees you - and this is [His] watching over of the state of [your] struggle (mujāhada).</text>

He (s) said: We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in their own souls (41:53). The outer signs lead to the knowledge of certainty (ʿilm al-yaqīn) while the inner signs lead to the essence of certainty (ʿayn al-yaqīn).</text>
      <text>The allusion to the alternation of night and day is to the alternation of the nights of the servants. The nights of the people of communion are short and the nights of the people of separation are long. [One person] said this:</text>
      <text>Months pass -</text>
      <text>we have not noticed</text>
      <text>their midpoints</text>
      <text>or ends.</text>
      <text>And he said:</text>
      <text>Your morning is drunkenness</text>
      <text>and the night is a hangover.</text>
      <text>You slept while</text>
      <text>the days of happiness are short.</text>
      <text>The second one said:</text>
      <text>Nights after the travelers left</text>
      <text>have long shapes.</text>
      <text>[Now] the night of the lovers</text>
      <text>is long.</text>
      <text>The third one had nothing to say about the length or brevity of the night, for he said, because of what overwhelmed him:</text>
      <text>How should I know</text>
      <text>whether the night was long or not?</text>
      <text>How can one</text>
      <text>who is roasting know that?</text>
      <text>If I had been occupied</text>
      <text>with the length of the night,</text>
      <text>I would have been deprived</text>
      <text>of watching the stars.</text>
      <text>For people of pith: The people of pith are those whose intellects have been kept sound from the drunkenness of forgetfulness. The sign of one who is like that is that his gaze will be through the Real. When he gazes from the Real to the Real, his gaze is direct. But when he gazes from the creation to the Real, his characteristic is the opposite and his thoughts are altered, causing confusion.</text>
      <text>Those who remember God, standing and sitting: Remembrance has claimed every one of their moments, so that if they stand it is in remembrance of Him. If they sit or sleep or prostrate, all of their states are consumed in the realities of remembrance.</text>

      <text>'People' (al-nās) is a generic noun whose etymology is uncertain. It is said man (al-ins) is called human (ins) because of his outward visibility (ẓuhūr). According to this, the allusion is: 'O you who I have made appear from the concealment of non-existence (ʿadam) by the decree of My prescriptive command (taklīf), then I chose whom I willed from you for My honoring, and deprived whom I willed among you of My guidance and giving knowledge, and moved you to what I willed - rather, conjoined you to what I willed by the decree of My free disposal'.</text>

He said to those who know, 'O you who have forgotten your worldly portion in Us, and have kept your glance and expression from any other, your right has become of great magnitude for Us. Helping you has become incumbent with Us and your value has been exalted before us.</text>
      <text>It is said, 'O you who have been gladdened (anista) by the breeze of My hospitality, who have found rest in the witness of My face, and who have been overcome by the majesty of My measure - you are the most sublime of My servants to Me'.</text>

      <text>Whoever has been given charge over others and then acts unjustly towards those under his charge, his adversary is his Lord, for He (s) avenges for His servants what He does not avenge for His own sake.

      <text>God granted free men the right to marry four women at the same time. He mandated justice between them, so the servant must respect what is obligatory. If he knows that in choosing this permitted thing, he would attempt to uphold this obligation but would fall short in it, he should not do it since the obligation is something for which he is responsible.</text>
      <text>[4:4 cont'd] but if they are pleased to offer you any of it of their own accord, consume it with wholesome appetite.</text>
      <text>This denotes the fact that the food of the chivalrous (fityān) and generous is wholesome because they only feed others from good-heartedness. The food of the miserly is rotten because they look only to themselves and feed others out of obligation not good-heartedness.

      <text>Which God has assigned to you as maintenance: Holding to decent behavior in the situation is more profitable for you than to expose yourself to loss of honor, petitioning, begging and contrivances. Making sacrifices is better than withholding from the point of view of freeing the heart and relying on patience, but to intend to ask from others and to make yourself and your dependents a burden on people - it is more suitable to preserve a sufficient amount for yourselves from what God has assigned to you. Then you can be generous with what it in excess of your needs.</text>
      <text>Provide for them thereof, and clothe them, and speak to them decent words: When what you possess is ample enough to extend to their circumstances, do not hold back from what you know of their needs out of fear of poverty in the future.

      <text>The rule of inheritance does not vary because of virtue or good qualities, nor is it different because of fault, defect or sin. If a man dies leaving two sons, their rights are equivalent even if one of them is pious and God-fearing and the other wicked and disobedient. The God-fearing one does not get more because of his God-fearingness and the wicked one does not get less because of his wickedness. Likewise, the rule of faith is the beginning of a gift for Muslims. God Most High said: Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants whom We chose. [35:32]. Then He said: Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves, and some of them... [35:32].</text>

      <text>When the division of the inheritance is attended by those who possess its shares and are the legal heirs, and others who have no [legal] portion and who are poor [also] attend, do not deprive them of that, for surely the one who is legally entitled has been given responsibility. Say to them, 'When the youth attains full age, we speak to him so that he will give us something' and this is the meaning of His words: and speak to them honorable words. In this is a subtle allusion to those who have sinned. When they are present at His court in the future and the Real (s) pardons those who were obedient and gives them the rewards for their deeds, He will not deprive the poor Muslims among you of the pardon, if God wills, after they were among the people (ahl) of faith. Likewise, you were not present on the day of division and you have no prior entitlement.

      <text>God charges you concerning your children, to the male the equivalent of</text>
      <text>the portion of two females; and if they be women more than two, then for them</text>
      <text>two-thirds of what he leaves; but if she be one then to her a half; and to his</text>
      <text>parents, to each one of the two the sixth of what he leaves, if he has a child; but</text>
      <text>if he has no child, and his heirs are his parents, then to his mother a third; or, if</text>
      <text>he has siblings, to his mother a sixth after any bequest that he may bequeath, or</text>
      <text>any debt.</text>
      <text>Thc word 'charge' (waṣiyya) here means 'command'. He (s) set the terms of the inheritance among the inheritors for what is due from two aspects - the apportioning and the inheritance by the group of relatives (taʿṣīb). The inheritance by the group of relatives is stronger than the apportioning because it comprises all of the wealth whereas the greater part of the portions cannot exceed two-thirds [of the estate]. Therefore, the division [of the estate] begins with those who possess of the ordained portions and they are they weakest in terms of entitlement while the group of relatives (ʿaṣaba) has the stronger right. [The Prophet] (ṣ) said: Whatever remains of the portions goes to the nearest male relative. Thus is His way (sunna) forever, just as in [God] Most High's words: Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants whom We chose. [35:32] We gave them the Book as the inheritance. Then He showed preference for the wrongdoer over those who take the lead. [Those who take the lead] are weaker in their claims for the showing of generosity with the wrongdoers because [the latter] are broken-hearted and unable to withstand the prolonged deferral.</text>
      <text>To the male the equivalent of the portion of two females: If the matter were to be by strict measuring, the female would be more worthy in being preferred because of her weakness and her inability to move about freely, but His decree (s) does not require justification (ghayr al-muʿallal).</text>
      <text>[4:11 cont'd] Your parents and children - you know not which of them is nearer in</text>

If it be a man leaving an inheritance and not having a direct heir, or it be a woman, but it be that such, has a brother or a sister, then to each of the two a sixth; but if they be more than that, then they share a third after any bequest to be bequeathed or any debt without prejudice; a charge from God. God is Knowing, Forbearing.</text>
      <text>The allusion in establishing inheritance for relatives by blood and marriage is that the relative is sorrowful when the individual dies so God compensates the heir for what he endures and alleviates his heart from the ache with the inherited wealth. Thus His way (s) is to compensate for the suffering of the injured, a generosity from Him, not an obligation upon Him, as some people imagine. All those who were closest by blood or strongest by marital tie to the deceased are the most entitled to his inheritance. With regards to its meaning, they have recited:</text>

      <text>Verily He made allowances in proving lewdness, which is fornication, for an excessive amount of witnessing, in order to lower the veil of generosity over the sins of servants. Indeed, the establishment of the act of witnessing in the way in which it exists in the law for proving this situation is like the one who pleads for the defense.</text>
      <text>In [the Prophet's words] (ṣ) when Māʿiz ibn Mālik said to him, 'O Messenger of God, may the blessings of God be upon you, I have fornicated', he said: Maybe you kissed?

A condition of the prescriptive command is that faith be hidden. Moreover, when one has become recognized as disloyal on this path, there is no smelling the truth of sincerity after it.

Whoever engages in that, God will take revenge on him and will not bless him in what he has taken for himself from people's wealth through deception and trickery. Whoever deems his adversary insignificant - God will punish him with something more humbling, holding him back from reaching what he hopes for in what he loves.</text>
      <text>Consort with them in kindness: i.e. by the teachings of the religion, the adoption of refined behavior through the ethics of those who submit, and beautiful companionship in spite of the dislikes of the lower self. It is that you tolerate any offense on their part while not making them bear the burden of servicing you, and that you shut your eyes to the occasions of their embarrassment.</text>
      <text>For if you hate them, it may happen that you hate a thing...: The end result of everything which is the most difficult for your lower self is more gratifying and chivalrous. Know that the Real (s) has not shown anyone His Unseen and the good of most of that which mankind feels aversion to may be more perfect. God (s) has decreed that opposing the lower self will bring its possessor to a higher station, while the reverse will be the case for those who make themselves harmonious with it. Similarly, opposition to the heart necessarily brings about blindness in the faculty of insight, while the reverse will be the case for those who make themselves harmonious with it.</text>

God is ever Forgiving, Merciful.</text>
      <text>To endeavor to find the intrinsic meanings behind the prohibitions is an impossible matter because the law does not need to be shown as having a cause (ghayr al-muʿallal). Instead, the Real (s) prohibits what He wills for whom He wills, and likewise gives permission. There is no underlying cause (ʿilla) for the laws at all: if the prohibited women were to be the permissible ones or the permissible women were to be the prohibited ones, it would be allowable.</text>

Lawful for you beyond all that is that you seek using your wealth, in wedlock and not in illicitly. Such wives as you enjoy thereby, give them their wages as an obligation; you are not at fault in agreeing together, after the obligation. God is ever Knowing,Wise.</text>
      <text>When you stay mindful of the limits, respect agreements and obtain mutual consent with women according to the law, there will be no enmity in it for people and no punishment to follow from it from the Real (s), for that is lawful and without further restriction.</text>

      <text>And whoever has not the means wherewith to be able to marry believing women in wedlock, let him take believing maids whom your right hands own. God knows very well your faith; the one of you is as the other. So marry them, with the permission of their folk, and give them their wages, honorably, as women in wedlock, not illicitly, or taking lovers. But when they are given in wedlock, if they commit lewdness, they shall be liable to half the chastisement, of married women. That is for those of you who fear the distress of sin, yet it is better for you to be patient. God is Forgiving, Merciful.</text>
      <text>Concessions have been granted for the weak. As for the strong, He bids them to serious endeavor, and the adoption of prudence and restraint, since there is no work for them except the concern for the right of the Real (ḥaqq al-ḥaqq). When an external matter distracts [the seekers] from watching over their hearts, then the adoption of what is easy in external matters and what is less becomes more natural than investigating what keeps one from watching over the innermost self - because that is the abandonment of some affairs for what is more important and sublime. So whoever has descended in degree from adopting that which is strongest and most comprehensive, the permissible for him becomes a decline into a state of indulgence.</text>
      <text>Then He said at the end of the verse: yet it is better for you to be patient. It means enduring what is difficult in it and in this is a kind of sympathetic disposition to the servant since He did not say, 'Be patient', but rather yet it is better for you to be patient.</text>

      <text>When the Prophet (ṣ) informed his community of the stories of those from past communities and what they did and how they were dealt with, they looked to what would be done with them since there were also among them those who did the impermissible. So they said, 'If only we knew in what way he will deal with us. Will it be abasement, metamorphosis, punishment or what?' So God Most High said: and to guide you in the ways of those before you, We will inform you of that which we did with them.</text>

      <text>Do not covet that in which God has preferred some of you above others. To men a share from what they have earned and to women a share from what they have earned. And ask God of His bounty; God is ever Knower of all things.</text>
      <text>In the language of right conduct, the command is to toil, not covet. In the language of declaring God's unity, the command is to the [divine] decree and judgment, not desire and wants. It is said, 'Travel the road of those who came before you in your concern for the right of God. Do not ask to obtain what they were selected for from the favor of God. Concern yourselves with the right of your Master, not with following your whims and choosing what you want'.</text>
      <text>It is said, 'Do not covet the station of lords without traveling their paths, cleaving to their course, and doing what they do, for that is a distorted way of thinking'.</text>
      <text>It is said, 'Be a seeker of His rights, not a seeker of your portion or your right. If you start seeking what you wish for yourself, you have unconsciously added partners to your profession of God's unity'.</text>
      <text>It is said, 'Do not covet stations of men, for each has a station appropriate before God'. They are counted out so that until someone has died, his place will not be inherited by another. God Most High said: He has made you successors (6:165; 10:14; 10:73; 35:39) and the successor is the one who succeeds from those who came before him. If you covet the station of one of the friends, it is as if you are seeking to hasten his passing in all or in part of what you covet, and that is injurious.</text>
      <text>It is said your extinction beneath the course of His decree according to what has already been established by His choosing is more fortunate for you than looking to obtain your desires since your ruin may lie in the object of your desire.</text>
      <text>It is said whoever's outward nature has not been educated in the different kinds of right conduct, his inward nature has not been refined by the different kinds of waystations. So he should not attempt to obtain intimate communications - that would be preposterous!</text>
      <text>And ask God of His bounty: The distinction between coveting and asking for His bounty has several aspects: Coveting something is accompanied by your heedlessness of your Lord, so you covet in your heart the existence of that thing without anticipating it from God.</text>

      <text>Men are in charge of women because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other, and because of what they expend of their property. Therefore righteous women are obedient, guarding in the unseen because of what God has guarded. And those you fear may be rebellious, admonish them, and share not beds with them, and strike them. If they then obey you, do not seek a way against them. God is ever High, Great.</text>
      <text>He singled out men for strength and then increased their burden, for the burden is in accordance with the strength. The admonition is for hearts and aspirations, not for the lower selves and bodies.</text>
      <text>And those you fear may be rebellious, admonish them, and share not beds with them, and strike them: i.e. increase your correction of them gradually and with kindness, for if the matter can be reconciled with admonition there is no need to use the rod to strike. The verse contains the good manners of spousal companionship.</text>
      <text>Then He said: If they then obey you, do not seek a way against them.

      <text>And worship God: Servanthood is attaching yourself closely to the command and separating yourself from the rebuke.</text>
      <text>And associate nothing with Him: The outwardly apparent form of associating another reality with God is to believe in objects of worship other than Him, while its hidden form is looking to any existing thing other than Him. Declaring His unity is to recognize that all contingent things are brought into being by God and subsist through Him. He is the One who causes things to happen, brings things forth and causes them to remain. There is not an atom, a splinter, a sīna or the slightest trace belonging to anyone in the bringing forth of things into existence or originating new things.</text>
      <text>The subtle forms of showing off, the hidden acts of guile, the secret places of pride, the doing of things in consideration of created beings, the seeking of the pleasure of their praise and wilting at their rejection and censure - all that is the hidden polytheism.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, draw not near to prayer, whilst you are inebriated, until you know what you are saying, nor whilst you are defiled, unless you are traversing a way, until you have washed yourselves. But if you are sick, or on a journey, or if any of you comes from the privy, or you have touched women; and you can find no water, wholesome soil, and wipe your faces and your hands. God is ever Pardoning, Forgiving.</text>
      <text>The prohibition against drinks which cause intoxication is not [a prohibition] from prayer. That is to say you should not come to prayer when you are inebriated, so you should avoid drinking that which will intoxicate you. Moreover, when you come to prayer in that condition, the prayer will not be accepted from you.</text>
      <text>Intoxication is the loss of mental functioning and awareness, and with it intimate conversation with the Real is not appropriate. The one who is praying speaks intimately with his Lord, so anything which causes the heart to be unmindful of God is included in this by way of allusion and for this reason becomes part of this category. Intoxication is of several types: there is intoxication by wine and intoxication from the heedlessness that comes from being overcome by love for the present world. The most difficult intoxication is your intoxication with your lower self, and it is that which plunges you into separation from Him. If someone is intoxicated from wine, the end of his affair is burning if he is not forgiven. Someone who is intoxicated with himself, his state is separation in the moment from reality. As for the intoxication which the folk allude to, its possessor has his moment protected from it so that he may pray and the matter will be made easy for him. Then when he leaves prayer, it overwhelms him and seizes him [again]. [The intoxication of] those who are not protected in the precepts of the law is mixed with worldly concern.</text>
      <text>Nor whilst you are defiled, unless you are traversing a way: He gives permission to those who are compelled to take liberties when crossing through the place of prayer in the state of major ritual impurity, but if one deviates more than is necessary, than one deserves reproof without being excused.</text>

If they had hastened to reject the envy they felt and accepted his state with veneration and honoring, they would have found blessing in following him and they would have found happiness in both abodes.

      <text>Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book, how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Ṭāghūt, and say to the disbelievers, 'These are more rightly guided than the believers'? * Those are the ones whom God has cursed; and he whom God has cursed,</text>
      <text>you will never find for him any helper.</text>
      <text>The ṭāghūt of each person is his lower self and his whim, and the idol he seeks among that which is other than Him. When someone pays heed to a person, or looks to a reason, or turns to a cause, or obeys a whim, that thing is his jibt and his ṭāghūt. The companions of al-Jibt and al-Ṭāghūt deserve the curse, which is being expelled from the carpet of service and veiled from witnessing lordship.</text>

      <text>To return trusts to their people is to hand over the states of created beings to them after you having watched over them so that you do not act in a corrupt manner with [the people]. It is said God (swt) deposited trusts with you, so returning the trust to its people is handing it over to God (s), secure from any breach of faith on your part regarding it. Faithlessness in the trust of the heart is your making claims with regard to it and faithlessness in the trust of your innermost self is your paying it heed [rather than God].</text>
      <text>To judge between people with justice is to treat the near and distance equally in giving and expending, and [it is also] that you do not allow pervasive resentment to lead you to take revenge on any soul.</text>

      <text>O you who believe, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. If you should quarrel about anything, refer it to God and the Messenger, if you believe in God and the Last Day; that is better and more excellent in interpretation.</text>
      <text>He compares obedience to Him with obedience to the Messenger (ṣ), an honoring of his affair and an elevation of his status. Those in authority (ūlū al-amr), in the language of scholarly knowledge, is the prevailing ruler (sulṭān). According to the explanation of deeper knowledge (maʿrifa), the one who has deeper knowledge (ʿārif) is the possessor of authority (dhū'l-amr) over the one who is just starting out, and the shaykh is the possessor of authority over the aspirant, and the imam of each group is the possessor of authority over them.</text>
      <text>It is said the friend and governor (walī) of the aspirant is more worthy (awlā) than the aspirant than the aspirant is for the aspirant.</text>
      <text>If you should quarrel about anything, refer it to God: In the language of scholarly knowledge, this means the Book and the Sunna. According to the explanation of declaring God's unity, it is to commit and entrust knowledge of it to God (s). When two thoughts are in disagreement in the heart of the believer, then if he has the effort of scholars, he contemplates what comes to his mind through that which this understanding points to. A master of a heart entrusts that to the Real (s) and observes what is addressed to him in its inner secrets and cast into his heart without any intermediary.</text>

      <text>Making light of all the stuff of your lower self for the sake of your beloved is the strongest of the signs of your companionship.</text>

But for the believers, the Knower of their secrets is their Friend and Protector. They speak with Him about what comes to them and have no need to broadcast the secret to any created being. The Hearer of their whispered confidence is God and the Knower of their hidden affairs is God.</text>
      <text>If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them...: i.e., if they had brought their secrets to those who are intimate friends and those who are among the people of the story, they would have dispelled their doubts and would have helped them through the light of guidance and spiritual instruction.</text>

      <text>They long that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, so then you would be equal; therefore do not take friends from among them until they emigrate in the way of God; then, if they turn away, take them and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron, or as a helper. * Except those who attach themselves to a people between whom and you there is a covenant, or come to you with their breasts constricted about the prospect of fighting you, or fighting their people. Had God willed, He would have given them sway over you, so that assuredly they would have fought you.</text>
      <text>And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then God does not allow you any way against them.</text>
      <text>The allusion is to the masters of confusion and sickly states who wish that the sincere would be like them. How preposterous would it be for their desire to be actualized! As long as those who are oppositional are not in harmony with you, leave them, oppose them, and do not concur with them in any way. Do not associate with them, and do not take any of them as a friend or helper. Someone who agrees with you in your goal is better for you than associating with someone who opposes with antipathy.</text>
      <text>Except those who attach themselves to a people...: The allusion in this verse is that He gives leave, for the excuses given, to associate outwardly in a friendly manner with those who are oppressed.</text>
      <text>And so if they stay away from you...: The allusion in it is when someone who is not one of the people of the story associates with you, and they are intent upon remaining in the familiar regions of their worldly share, do not call them to your path but submit your circumstances to them in peace. Verily He has given you the power to regard them with the eye of mercy, as your intentions choose regarding them, so submit your circumstances to them in peace.</text>

      <text>You will find others desiring to have security from you and security from their own people; yet whenever they are returned to sedition, they are overwhelmed by it. So, if they do not stay away from you, and offer you peace, and restrain their hands, then take them and slay them wherever you come upon them; against them We have given you clear warrant.</text>
      <text>Whoever desires the gathering of two opposing things, his effort is ruined and his resolve does not grow. Just as no individual can be both a hypocrite and a Muslim, no individual can be desirous of the Real and remain with the precepts of the people of habit. Verily spiritual desire and habit are opposites, and it is necessary to distinguish things which are opposites and to distance yourself from that which has no relation to you.</text>

      <text>It is not for a believer to slay a believer, except by mistake. He who slays a believer by mistake, then let him set free a believing slave, and blood-money is to be submitted to his family, unless they remit it as a charity. If he belongs to a people at enmity with you and is a believer, then the setting free of a believing slave. If he belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant, then the blood-money must be paid to his family, and the setting free of a believing slave. But if he has not the wherewithal, then the fasting of two successive months, a relenting from God. And God is ever Knowing, Wise.</text>
      <text>He mitigated the matter of the mistake for the perpetrator to the point of giving the burden of restitution to the larger group responsible for the bloodwit. The elite are those responsible for the bloodwit of the weak in the community and the people of mystical knowledge are those responsible for the bloodwit of the aspirants. The shaykhs are those responsible for the bloodwit of the disciples (fuqarāÌ), so their way is to bear the burdens of the weak in what afflicts them.</text>

It is natural that his outcome is unpleasant in that he cannot enjoy what he has held back from the aspirants in his states.

      <text>The shortening of prayers is the recommended practice (sunna) in travel. Although first legislated in a time of fear, it remained even without the fear, in kindness to [God's] servants. When the shortening of prayers because of traveling became obligatory (far?), they were given leave for supererogatory devotion on their camel mount as a substitution, in whichever way [the mount] turned without seeking the qibla, and likewise for the person on foot. This was so that it would be known that permission to engage in talk with God is ongoing, at any time. If you wish to take part in it, you may do so whenever you wish. If you want to stay away as permitted, you may do as you wish. This is the most extraordinary kindness and a protection of the practice (sunna) of faithfulness (wafāÌ) and the confirmation of the meaning of friendship (walāÌ).</text>

You are not at fault, if rain bothers you, or if you are sick, to lay aside your weapons. But take your precautions; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement.</text>
      <text>This verse indicate that [the obligation of] prayer is not lifted from the servant so long as there is a breath remaining in him to choose, neither in fear nor in security, and neither when you are in a state of separation where the precepts of the law predominate, nor when you are at the source of gathering where there is the overwhelming authority of reality.</text>

      <text>Were it not for God's bounty to you and His mercy, a party of them would have intended to lead you astray; but they lead only themselves astray; they will not hurt you at all. God has revealed to you the Book and wisdom, and He has taught you what you did not know; and God's bounty to you is ever great.</text>
      <text>Bounty (fa?l) is undeserved beneficence. The allusion here in 'bounty' is to His protection (iṣma) of him, for the Real (s) protected him, singling him out specially for this protection. Just as He protected him from abandoning His right, He protected him in holding him back from the deception of His creation, so He said: Were it not for God's bounty to you and His mercy... On the contrary, there will be no way that anyone can lead you astray for you are in the grip of the Glory and they lead only themselves astray and they will not hurt you at all, since that which is guarded (maḥfūẓ) by Us is secured from anything else. Verily God (s) has favored you for the revelation of the Book and has chosen you for the different aspects of favor and affirmation. And He has taught you what you did not know. What He has granted to you is unlike anything that He has granted to those He has chosen for knowledge. It is possible that He meant by it his (ṣ) knowledge of God and His Majesty, his knowledge of his own servanthood, and the measure of his state in the worthiness of its rare might and beauty.</text>
      <text>It is said He has taught you what you did not know of the good manners of service, since the mystical knowledge of reality has not been ambiguous for you.</text>
      <text>It is said He made you free of the instruction of any others so that none would have a light except that borrowed from your light. Those who do not walk under your banner will not reach the entirety of Our kindness and will not receive the good fortune of Our nearness and communion.</text>
      <text>And God's bounty to you is ever great in endless eternity. You were known to Us in the nobility of rare might and the honor of rank in all sempiternity. It is said He has taught you what you did not know of the sublimity of your rank over all others.</text>

      <text>There is no good in much of their secret conversations, except for he who enjoins to voluntary almsgiving, or kindness, or setting things right between people. And whoever does that, desiring God's good pleasure, We shall surely give him a great wage.</text>
      <text>The best of actions is the one whose blessing extends beyond the actor to others and the excellence of almsgiving is that its benefit extends beyond the one who receives your gift. Chivalry (futūwwa) is to exert yourself for others. In the tradition [the Prophet said]: The worst of mankind are those who eat by themselves. The term 'almsgiving' (ṣadaqa) can be applied to every kind of good action (iḥsān). He (ṣ) said regarding the shortening of prayers in travel: This is an almsgiving which God has given you, so accept His almsgiving.</text>
      <text>Almsgiving is of several types: your almsgiving to your soul and your almsgiving to others. Your almsgiving to your soul is your prompting it to perform the rights of God Most High, to restrain it from opposing His command, to hold back its hand from harming created beings, and to defend its thoughts and beliefs from evil. Your almsgiving to others is the almsgiving of wealth, the heart and the body. The almsgiving of wealth is the expenditure of riches, the almsgiving of the body is through performing service, and the almsgiving of the heart is through good intention and positive aspiration. Almsgiving to the poor is an external act about which there are no doubts. Almsgiving to the rich would be your giving liberally to them through them (ʿalayhim bihim ?), and that you cut off your hope from them and do not desire them.</text>
      <text>As for kindness, everything good in the law is kindness and from that is aid (injād) to Muslims. Their support (isʿād) in what they have in it is nearness to God and intimacy with Him, and rising up together to obey. Whoever gives alms through his lower self in obeying His Lord, and gives alms through his heart to the good pleasure of His decree, He will not take revenge for his self and will encourage people according to what is in it (them?) to their salvation in guidance to His Lord. He will set things right between people by his almsgiving in his state, for surely the tongue of his action is more eloquent in admonition than the tongue of his speech, and he is the sincere one of his time.</text>

One who resists the allusions to that which is sought from the path of the inner deserves the punishments of hearts, among which are that he is blinded from the insights of his own rectitude, just as the one who resists consensus (ijmāʿ) in religion is an outsider (khārij), so the one who resists what is known from reality after what the path has distinguished for him has stumbled (sāqiṭ).</text>

      <text>God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him; He forgives all except that, to whomever He will. Whoever associates anything with God, verily he has strayed far away. * What they pray to instead of Him are but females, and they only pray to a rebellious satan. * God has cursed him. And he said, 'Assuredly I will take to myself an appointed portion of Your servants. * And I will surely lead them astray, and surely I will fill them with desires; and surely I will command them and they will cut up the cattle's ears. And surely I will command them and they will change God's creation'. And whoever takes Satan for a patron, instead of God, has surely suffered a manifest loss.</text>
      <text>God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him: To acknowledge anything other than Him, imagining even an atom in being the cause of originating, is the source of polytheism (shirk) and there is no possibility of pardon for it, while there is a possibility for pardon for other things. Whoever seeks access to Him (s) by means of what he himself has imagined is associating others with Him with respect to what he does not know. No, He is God, the One.</text>
      <text>What they pray to instead of Him are but females: They set up inanimate things given names and plunged forward into delusion. They relied on the errors of conjecturing and were led astray from the truth.</text>
      <text>And they only pray to a rebellious satan. God has cursed him: i.e. what they prayed to was none other than Iblīs whom the Real distanced from His mercy and removed in estrangement. Iblīs is only one who is turned about in the grip according to what the Creator wants. If there were even an atom to acknowledge in him, it would be an associate in divinity. On the contrary, the Real (s) sets circumstances in motion over created beings. He creates what follows his whisperings to created beings in being led astray, for He is the Guide and the One Who leads astray. He (s) is the One Who has free disposal over all. God Most High created in their hearts what follows his whisperings to them in the power of their hopes. He makes ugly actions seem beautiful in their eyes and then He does not make any actualization for their desires and does not follow in confirming what they had hoped for. He Most High is the one who brings into existence these effects as a whole and attributes them to Satan at one time and to the unbeliever at another. This is the meaning of His saying: And I will surely lead them astray, and surely I will fill them with desires... and the meaning of His saying: He promises them, and fills them with desires [4:120].</text>

A remnant from the eye of separation must remain for the servant so that his performance of His rights (s) will be sound because if he were to be completely taken up in the real, his submitting and virtuousness would not be sound. This is following Abraham (ʿa) the ḥanīf. Nothing remained of him which could be described as perpetual.</text>
      <text>And God took Abraham for a close friend: He stripped the event from every effort, labor, seeking, and striving when He said this, so that it would be known that friendship is a clothing the Real puts on one, not an attribute the servant acquires.</text>
      <text>It is said the friend is entirely in need of the Real at every breath. There is nothing from it for him that is not through God and for God in every one of his breaths and states, a longing from the friendship which is privation and need.</text>
      <text>It is said it is from that friendship which is love and the friendship that love reaches every part of him and permeates his innermost self until there is no possibility in it for any other.</text>
      <text>When God (s) purified him (ʿa) of it, and emptied from him his portion for the performance of His right after his erasure from everything that is not God (s).</text>
      <text>Then He said: And announce among the people the [season for] Pilgrimage [22:27]. The pilgrim does not say 'labayyka' except to God and this is an allusion to the gathering of the gathering (jamʿ al-jamʿ).</text>

      <text>They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning women. Say: 'God pronounces to you concerning them, and what is recited to you in the Book, concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them for you desire to marry them, and the oppressed children and that you deal justly with orphans. Whatever good you do, God is ever Knower of it'.</text>
      <text>He prohibited them from coveting that which would prompt them to harm or do wrong to the oppressed among women and orphans. He explained that the God is their avenger and whoever treats them well for fear of God will not lose anything on account of God but rather will find a beautiful recompense. But whoever acts insolently with them will suffer a painful tribulation because of that.</text>

      <text>And if a woman fears from her husband ill-treatment or rejection (iʿrā?), they are not at fault if they are reconciled through some agreement; reconciliation is better. But greed has been made present in the souls. If you are virtuous and fear, surely God is ever aware of what you do.</text>
      <text>The companionship of people with one another, if it is disengaged from the discourse of the Real, will surely risk alienation and blame and will be mixed with antipathy and disgust. Whoever turns away (ʿara?a) from God in his heart, people turn away from protecting his right and all come out against him in finding his affair pathetic and regarding his worth as contemptible. But whoever returns to God in his heart, his affair will be balanced as a whole and in the particular. His chest will expand with the capacity to bear what he faces in people's bad traits. He will draw the skirt of pardon over the defects of all of them and prefer reconciliation in abandoning his portion and handing over their portion. God Most High said: Reconciliation is better.</text>
      <text>To ignore your own aversion to those who quarrel with you is more appropriate for you and more advantageous than being arrogant with your foe out of a desire for revenge and presenting evidence for that which belongs to you in privilege. Most people are in the fetters of this tribulation.</text>
      <text>But greed has been made present in the souls: The greed of the lower self is the concern of the servant for his worldly portion. Whoever is veiled from witnessing the Real is inevitably brought back to witnessing the lower self.</text>
      <text>If you are virtuous: It means that would be better for you. Being virtuous is that you worship God as if you see him.</text>
      <text>And fear: It means [fear] your looking to your own status and worth. Rather look to your Lord and in seeing Him be annihilated from any vision of your own worth.</text>
      <text>Surely God is ever aware of what you do: It means when you are annihilated from yourselves and your acting, God is the best to know after your annihilation and the best to bring things about after your effacement.</text>

      <text>It means when you are concerned for yourself in your affairs, the situation is reflected back on you, and the soundness of your union becomes the reverse by a corruption on your part. But when you have made God your concern in your affairs, your way of living will become balanced and the moment will be cleared of turmoil.</text>
      <text>It is said whomever God has determined to be deficient in intellect in his state, you are not able to set their deficiency right by your ability.</text>

      <text>So that you leave her like one suspended: It means that you when you prevent them from the companionship of others and then cut them off from their shares with you, you cause them harm in two ways: there is nothing to be had from you nor is there any way to someone else. Surely this harm is great. The allusion in this is to the fact that when the path to your worldly concerns is blocked to you, He (s) opens the witnessing of His right to you and the finding of His kindness. Surely whoever's annihilation is in God, the Real is his substitute. If you make right what is between you and other people, and put your trust in what is between you and the Real, surely God will be forgiving of your failings and merciful in pardoning your sins.</text>

      <text>'Justice' (qisṭ) is being fair and equitable (ʿadl). Being upright through God in fairness is fulfilling His rights against you and seeking to have His rights fulfilled among everyone with whom you have business. The way to make that happen is either through an exhortation to act kindly or a rebuke concerning something despicable or admonitory advice or direction to a legal issue or guidance to a duty. Whoever has a duty (ḥaqq) remaining owed to God, the purest part of realization (taḥqīq) will not touch his innermost self. The root of religion is to prefer the rightful due of the Real (ḥaqq al-ḥaqq) over the right of created beings. Whoever prefers anyone to God, whether it be a father, mother, child, kinsman, or relation; or holds back any portion from Him, is not upright in justice.</text>

      <text>Those who take disbelievers for friends instead of believers - do they desire power with them? Truly, power belongs altogether to God. * It has been revealed to you in the Book that: 'When you hear God's signs being disbelieved in and mocked, do not sit with them until they engage in some other talk, for otherwise you would surely be like them'. God will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers, all together, into Hell.</text>
      <text>Whoever clings to a created thing has sought refuge to something other than the One Who can provide it for him. He relies on a place that will provide no shelter and has fallen into a bottomless abyss of error, its ruse powerful. Do they desire power with those who have been stricken with the lowly position of coming to be? How can they have any power to determine the truth? Whoever has no power attached to him, how can he extend power to anyone else?</text>
      <text>It is said. 'We do not know what part of their condition is more ugly: seeking power while they are themselves in the lowly position of subjugation and held in the grasp, or assuming or imagining it is from something other than God?'</text>
      <text>It is said anyone who seeks something from anything other than His Face, failure (ikfāq) is the end of his effort (jahdihi). Whoever desires wealth in regions of want, being reduced to poverty (imlāq) is the outcome of his toil (kaddihi).</text>
      <text>It is said that if they had been guided to finding power, their objectives would not have been diverted to those who have nothing in their hands in the matter.</text>
      <text>Truly, power belongs altogether to God: The power is of two kinds: eternal power, which belongs to God by attribution, and a power of originating by which He (s) chooses whom He wills, which belongs to Him as an estate and is a kindness from it.</text>

      <text>The trickery of the hypocrites is their outward display of conformity on the path while they inwardly cling to belief in what is other than God (shirk).

      <text>Do you desire to give God over you a clear warrant?: He warned them about their friendship with the disbelievers over and above other oppositional acts because it involves a preference for something other than the appropriate object of adoration (maʿbūd). Preferring another to the beloved (maḥbūb) is the gravest of sins in the precepts of love.

How can one's heart be engaged with others in the place reserved for the Real?</text>

      <text>Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire; and you will never find a helper for them.</text>
      <text>This verse indicates that there is no seeking protection (mustaÌmin) for the hypocrites because being true to the trust (īmān) is what brings protection (amān). The one who holds true to the trust (muÌmin) is saved by his faith (īmān) from the Fire - faith cannot be the cause for one's falling to the lowest level of the Fire. It is said this is verified by His words: God is the best of schemers [3:54 and 8:30], which is to say He is beyond all schemes. When the scheming of the hypocrites with the believers was exposed, their punishment was more severe than the punishment of those whose disbelief was declared openly.</text>
      <text>It is said He transfers them from their present state to one that is more severe later, because of what is in the tradition: One meets God in whatever state one is in. Just as today the hypocrites are in the lowest level of abandonment, so will they be transferred to the lowest level of the Fire. The lowest level of abandonment in the present is that they have nothing that could be called "faith" (īmān). They have not even the slightest thing from God and this is the greatest of afflictions.</text>
      <text>It is said they deserve the lowest level of the Fire because they kept company here with the greatest name of God without respect (ḥurma). They were present in their speech but without any sense of propriety and by this one is driven away.</text>

      <text>Save those who repent, and make amends, and hold fast to God and make their religion purely God's; those are with the believers; and God will certainly give the believers a great wage.</text>
      <text>Although not all of these conditions are ordinarily required to repent of one's sin, they are necessary for hypocrites to desist from their hypocrisy because of the recalcitrance of the state of their disbelief. After their meeting these conditions, He said to them: those are with (maʿa) the believers. He did not say "among" (min) the believers, and in this is an allusion as well to the weakness of their rank, even though they have sincerely made amends for the evil they did in the past.

      <text>It is said [by others] that the preposition "with" (maʿa) indicates accompaniment, so that when they were included with the believers, they became deserving in the same way as the group of the believers. Repentance (tawba) here means they renounce their hypocrisy and make amends in the sincerity of their faith, and hold fast to God in absolving themselves of their own power and strength, and bearing witness to the blessing of God towards them in guiding them and delivering them from their hypocrisy, and make their religion purely God's. They perceive that their deliverance is by the grace of God, not by their states of faith in the present, nor by the renouncement of their past hypocrisy.</text>
      <text>It is said they make their religion purely God's means perpetually seeking God's help in strengthening them in faith and holding them fast from reverting to their past hypocrisy.</text>
      <text>It is said they repent from hypocrisy, and make amends through the purification of belief, and hold fast to God in asking for His favor, and make their religion purely God's in their deliverance by the grace and kindness of God, not by their having done anything to make it happen.</text>

      <text>Why would God chastise you if you are thankful and believe? God is ever Thankful, Knowing.</text>
      <text>This verse is among the verses which engender a beautiful hopefulness and powerful optimism because He has made two things, "thankfulness" (shukr) and "belief" (īmān), among the signs of protection (amān) in what is to come and these are easy and light qualities. Thankfulness is an assertion (qāla) and belief is a state (ḥāla). The way becomes easy for the servant when He is pleased with him in his words and state. Thankfulness is authentic only when one hears it from a believer rather than a disbeliever, because thankfulness indicates willing obedience (ṭāʿa) and this cannot be said to be true of those who do not believe.</text>
      <text>And believe, i.e., in what comes at the end. It is as if He is explaining that salvation will only be for those who, at the end of the day, believe. The meaning of the verse, then, is that God will not chastise you with the chastisement of abiding if you are thankful in your present state and put your trust in what is to come.</text>
      <text>It is said that if you are thankful and believe, you confirm the truth that your salvation in through God, not because of your thankfulness or your belief.</text>
      <text>It is said thankfulness is witnessing the blessing from God and belief is seeing God in the blessing. It is as if He said, "If you witness the blessing from God, then the witnessing of this blessing will certainly not cut you off from witnessing the One who gives the blessing".</text>
      <text>Kāna Allāh shākiran ʿalīman means Allah is ever Thankful, Knowing (Allāh shākirun ʿalīmun). The meaning of His being "thankful" is that He is the One who commends his servant and the One who calls to witness him in what he does. This is because the true sense and definition of thankfulness is praise for the one who acts in a beautiful way (muḥsin) for the beautiful action he does (iḥsān). "The servant gives thanks to God" means he praises Him for His beautiful action (iḥsān) towards him, which is His blessing to him. "God gives thanks to the servant" means that He praises [the servant] for his beautiful action (iḥsān), which is his willing obedience to Him.</text>

      <text>That which a person who has been wronged says about the one who has wronged him, by the permission of God, is not evil in the true sense of the word, but it is nonetheless a good thing to let the matter drop. As God Most High has said: For the requital of an evil is an evil deed like it (42:40). The requital is itself another evil action.</text>

      <text>Unless (illā) a person has been wronged: Some say "not even (wa lā) the one who has been wronged". Others say its meaning is: "but (wa-lakinna) a person who has been wronged" has the right to mention the one who has intentionally wronged him.</text>
      <text>It is said that those who do not prefer praising the Real over defaming created beings come up empty handed in the present moment.</text>
      <text>It is said that those who look to created beings with the eye of connecting to the Real, [seeing] that they are servants of God, will not loose the tongue of blame towards them.</text>
      <text>A man says to his companion, "Out of respect for you, I will bear the lowliest service to you, even beyond that which I would bear for my son."

      <text>It is said the utterance of evil words out loud among ordinary people is that they describe God without permission or favor.</text>

It will be a warning to them that they are heedless in witnessing the favor and an awakening to the fact that they should seek protection from being deprived of immunity and being abandoned so that they fall into discord and trial.</text>
      <text>It is said if you show good, acting well towards people, or conceal it, praying for them in secret, or pardon evil, even if you have been wronged.</text>
      <text>It is said show good towards those who act well towards you and be loyal in friendship and pray in secret for those who spare you from their evil. Pardon those who do evil to you with generosity and graciousness. You will find pardon from God according to what you yourself do, for surely your sins are more numerous. He is Powerful to give you in favor and blessings that which you cannot attain by taking vengeance or revenge.</text>

      <text>Those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and seek to divide between God and His messengers, and say, 'We believe in some, and disbelieve in some', and seek to adopt a way between them. ** Those are the disbelievers truly; and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement.</text>
      <text>Regarding them He related that they add to the ugliness of their disbelief that which is considered blameworthy in their actions. Then He explained that He has doubled their chastisement as requital for their sin so that you will know that there is a place lying in wait for those who corrupt.</text>

      <text>And those who believe in God and His messengers and do not seek to divide between any of them, those - We shall surely give them their wages. God is ever Forgiving, Merciful.</text>
      <text>When they believed in all of the messengers and confirmed everything to which they were commanded, they deserved acceptance and a beautiful recompense. The holding back of faith in some individuals is like holding back at certain periods of time. Just as He will not accept the faith of a person whose faith does not include all [...], likewise He will not accept the faith of a person whose faith does not include all of what faith demands of him, since He made that a condition for its actualization and perfection. The allusion in this is to the fact that anyone who does not wholeheartedly enter into the covenant will not have so much as a sliver of the reality of communion. The Prophet (ṣ) said: The pilgrimage is [the day of] ʿArafa. Anyone who cuts short the distance, even if he is from a deep ravine, and then holds back from ʿArafat the least bit, has not experienced the pilgrimage.</text>
      <text>The Prophet (ṣ) said: The servant who has contracted with his master to be freed is still a servant to the last dirham.</text>

      <text>The People of the Scripture will ask of you to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven. They asked Moses for something greater than that, for they said, 'Show us God openly'; so the thunderbolt seized them for their evildoing. They then took to themselves the [golden] calf after clear proofs had come to them; yet We pardoned that; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority.</text>
      <text>The verse includes two kinds of unseemly acts that they did. The first was their asking to be shown [God] and the second was their worshipping the calf after clear signs had been made manifest to them. As for their asking to be shown [God], they were blameworthy because they impudently demanded that, even after their excuses should have been cut off by the occurrence of miracles. They were therefore not seeking the vision for instruction, nor as a means to confirm their faith, nor were they brought to that by an intensity of longing. Both acts were bad manners (sūÌ adab). There is also the allusion to those who are content to have the calf as their object of worship. How can they bear witness to the Real when they submit to it?</text>
      <text>It is said direct mystical knowledge (ʿirfān) did not touch the innermost hearts (asrār) of the people. Because of that they clung with their intellects (ʿuqūl) to a limited thing (maḥdūd), allowing that to be their object of worship.</text>
      <text>And we bestowed upon Moses clear authority: manifest proof (hujja ẓāhir), indeed a light preserved from comparing God to other things (tamthīl) or stripping Him of His attributes (taʿṭīl).</text>
      <text>The clear authority is to have access (taḥṣīl) while declaring God incomparable (tanzīh), neither stripping God of His attributes (taʿṭīl) or comparing Him to His creation (tashbīh).</text>
      <text>It is said the clear authority is the power to hear the Speech (al-khiṭāb) without intermediary.</text>
      <text>It is said the clear authority belongs to this community in the future, which will be their abiding in the state of their meeting [God]. In the tradition of the Vision, [the Prophet] (ṣ) said: You will not have only one vision in seeing Him.</text>

      <text>So, for their breaking their covenant and disbelieving in the signs of God, and slaying the prophets wrongfully, and for their saying, 'Our hearts are covered up' - nay, but God sealed them for their disbelief; so they do not believe, except for a few.</text>
      <text>Its meaning is: Because of their committing these prohibited acts (manāhī) and because of their being marked by these requitals (majāzī), We have caused them to alight at the dwellings of ignominy (hawān) and inflicted on them punishments of all kinds (alwān).</text>
      <text>It is said that the terrible misfortune of oppositional acts afflicted them cumulatively. Among the consequences of disobedient acts is being left to commit even more prohibited acts. By violating the covenant and not repenting, they were pulled towards their disbelief in the signs. Then, because of the misfortune of their disbelief, they were left to themselves until they slew the prophets (ʿa) wrongfully. Then, because of the misfortune of that, they had the audacity to claim fullness in comprehension, saying "Our hearts are the vessels for all kinds of knowledge". God replied to them: but God sealed them for their disbelief, and He veiled them from the site of deep knowledge (ʿirfān) so they wandered about in their errors.</text>

      <text>calumny.</text>
      <text>Disregard for the limit is error, just as diminishment or subtraction from the truth is error. Some people slandered Mary and accused her of fornication. Others transgressed the limit even further in a terrible calumny, saying her son was the son of God. Both of these groups fell into error.</text>
      <text>It is said that Mary (r) was a friend (waliyya) of God through whom two groups became unfortunate: those who exceed all bounds (ahl al-ifrāṭ) and those who fall short (ahl al-tafrīṭ) Just as there are those who reject His friends in lacking respect for them, there are those who believe in them and will therefore suffer no increase in difficulties. It is among this group that most of the great rise in rank.</text>

      <text>And for their saying, 'We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God'. And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him, but he was given the resemblance. And those who disagree concerning him are surely in doubt regarding him. They do not have any knowledge of him, only the pursuit of conjecture; and they did not slay him for certain. Nay, God raised him up to Him. God is ever Mighty, Wise.</text>
      <text>It is said God caused the resemblance of [Jesus] to fall on one who slandered him, and he was killed and crucified in his place. It is said: The one who digs a grave for his brother falls into it".</text>
      <text>It is said [by others] that Jesus (ʿa) said, "Whoever agrees to have my resemblance cast upon him so that he is killed in place of me will have the Garden," and one of his companions agreed. It is said that when he patiently bore the injury (talaf), God did not deprive him of the recompense (khalaf).</text>
      <text>It is said that because the friendship of this man with Jesus (ʿa) was sound in his self (nafs), he became his friend in spirit (rūḥ) so that when Jesus (ʿa) was raised up to the place of intimacy (zulfa), the spirit of this one who ransomed [Jesus] with himself was raised up to the place of nearness (qurba).</text>

      <text>Because He ruled that there will be no security (amāna) for them at the time of despair, their faith (īmān) at that time will not benefit them.

      <text>It is said the committing of forbidden acts caused the prohibition of what had been [previously] allowed. Whoever commits a forbidden act outwardly is kept from what he had been finding in allowable states and the subtle kindnesses received in the inner secrets of his heart.</text>

      <text>But those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers, believing in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, and those who observe the prayer; and pay the alms, and those who believe in God and the Last Day - to them We shall surely give a great wage.</text>
      <text>[The verse refers to] the one who is firmly rooted in knowledge, the proof and judgement of which is not by blind following. Instead reflection (naẓr) has been put in its place to such an extent that there is no possibility of doubt in one's understanding (ʿaql).</text>
      <text>It is said the one who is firmly rooted in knowledge ascends from the limit of pondering demonstrative proof (burhān) to attain the realities of clear evidence (bayān).</text>
      <text>It is said the one who is firmly rooted in knowledge is one whose knowledge is practiced to the degree that he benefits from knowledge that is hidden from others, as in the tradition: To whoever practices what he knows, God grants knowledge of what he does not know.</text>
      <text>[The phrase] those who observe prayer is given the grammatical accusative inflection to indicate the laudative. Prayer is given distinction among other acts of worship in that it follows [the mention of] faith in most passages in the QurÌān, and because God (s) gave the command for prayer directly to the Messenger (ṣ) on the Night of the Miʿrāj without the intermediary of Gabriel (ʿa), and because of other reasons.</text>
      <text>A great wage: The great wage is that which increases commensurate with what the work deserves.</text>

      <text>The singling out of the Prophet (ṣ) from among the prophets is in [the call to] believe in [all of them] being singularly marked for distinction and merit.

They shared in being singled out because each was an illustration in merit according to station.

      <text>God's way (sunna) regarding his friends (awliyāÌ) is to veil some and to make others known. This is also His way with the prophets (ʿa). He proclaims the names of some and summarizes the individual details of others. Belief is obligatory in all the prophets as a whole and individually, just as respect is obligatory for all of the friends as a whole and individually. Likewise, He veils the states of some servants while making the states of others apparent. With regard to the states that he makes apparent, he asks for them to keep them pure. With regard to what He veils from them, He jealously protects their hearts from viewing their states as qualifying them for the privilege He has designated for them in the realities in their meanings.</text>

      <text>He made their barring believers from following the truth the equivalent of their disbelief in God. [In equating these two] God Most High extols the rights of His friends (awliyāÌ) just as He exalts His own right. Then He said: Surely those who disbelieve and who have done wrong. He made their wrong doing (ẓulm) the same as their disbelief and attached the justly deserved abiding punishment to both of these. Even if wrongdoing is not like disbelief in deserving the threat of endless duration, the misfortune of it is that it is not unlikely that God will abandon those who do it until they succumb to disbelief.</text>

So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say, 'Three'. Refrain, it is better for you. Verily, God is but One God. Glory be to Him, that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. God suffices as a Guardian.</text>
      <text>Their going to extremes in their religion was their following their own opinion, since they described what they worshipped in the likeness of created beings.

      <text>The Messiah would never disdain to be a servant of God, neither would the angels who are nigh. Whoever disdains to worship Him, and waxes proud, He will assuredly muster them to Him, all of them. * As for those who believed, who did righteous deeds, He will pay them in full their wages, and He will give them more of His bounty;</text>
      <text>How can they disdain the worship of Him when one's honor and dignity (sharaf) is through worship? How can they be too proud to humble themselves when one's ruin is in being too proud? Because of this matter, the first words the Messiah spoke were: Lo! I am God's servant [19:30]. The servant becomes beautiful in his humility towards masters. This is something well known and without doubt.</text>
      <text>Neither would the angels who are nigh does not imply that [the angels] are superior to the Messiah because He was only addressing them in accordance with their beliefs. They believed in the superiority of the angels over human beings.</text>
      <text>[4:173 cont'd] and as for them who disdain and are too proud, He will chastise them with a painful chastisement, and they shall not find for themselves, besides God, any friend or helper.</text>
      <text>The painful chastisement is that they will never attain it after they have come to know His Majesty.
