# QuranX hadith indexing information

This document contains information about the various hadith reference indexes provided for the hadith collections on QuranX.

General note: CMJE is the Centre for Muslim-Jewish Engagement, and in partnership with USC (University of South Carolina) they have a website on which were published the English translations of Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawud (partial), and Muwatta Malik hadith collections.

## Sahih Bukhari
The translation is that of Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, published by Dar-us-Salam. Used also on the CMJE (USC-MSA) and sunnah.com websites.

**Dar-us-Salam reference** = the hadith number found in the Dar-us-Salam English and Arabic print edition.

Corresponds to “Reference” for this collection on sunnah.com except for book 65 (book 60 in the USC-MSA reference system), where it corresponds to the “Arabic reference” hadith number.

**In-book reference** = the book number found in the Dar-us-salam edition, and sunnah.com's incremental hadith number starting at 1 for each book. 

Corresponds to the “In-book reference” for this collection on sunnah.com which they invented to give each hadith a unique url. The exception is book 65, where it instead corresponds to “Arabic reference” on sunnah.com. Here, instead of “Reference” and “In-book reference” sunnah.com have “Arabic reference”, which has both the Dar-us-Salam book and hadith numbers.

**USC-MSA web (English) reference** = the volume, book and hadith number on the CMJE (USC-MSA) website.

Corresponds to the “USC-MSA web (English) reference” for this collection on sunnah.com

Further notes:
* Quranx.com contains corrections for this index in this collection compared to mistakes on sunnah.com. 

* In late 2013/early 2014, USC inexplicably re-numbered the hadiths in Sahih Bukhari Book 2 to go from 8 to 56 (previously 7 to 55), even though Book 1 still ends with hadith 6 and Book 3 still starts with hadith 56. Most copies of their data on other websites have the original, sensible numbering, as does QuranX. 

## Sahih Muslim
Translation is by Abdul Hamid Sadiqqui, of the edition published by Sh. Muhammad Ashraf, Lahore. Used also on the CMJE (USC-MSA) and sunnah.com websites.

**Reference** = the round brackets (#) number in the Dar-us-salam English and Arabic edition (by another translator). 

Corresponds to “Reference” for this collection on sunnah.com

Further notes:
* This is not the square bracket number in the Dar-us-Salam edition, but rather the round bracket number that also appears there for each hadith, which was devised by the Islamic scholar Fuwad Abdul Baqi. This is a number commonly used when citing hadiths in Sahih Muslim.

* Some hadiths have single letter suffixes (a, b, c...) after the same hadith number (e.g. 2525). The suffixed hadiths will all appear on the same page for the hadith number on QuranX, but also from there the suffixed hadiths can be clicked individually for a unique url. 

**In-book reference** = the book number found in the Dar-us-salam edition, and sunnah.com's incremental hadith number starting at 1 for each book. 

Corresponds to the “In-book reference” for this collection on sunnah.com which they invented to give each hadith a unique url.


**USC-MSA web (English) reference** = the book and hadith number on the CMJE (USC-MSA) website.

Corresponds to the “USC-MSA web (English) reference” for this collection on sunnah.com


## Sunan Abu Dawud

Translation is by Ahmad Hasan, published by Sh. Muhammad Ashraf, Lahore. Used also on the CMJE (USC-MSA) and sunnah.com websites.

**Dar-us-Salam reference** = the hadith number found in the print edition of this collection in English and Arabic published by Dar-us-Salam (by a different translator).

Corresponds to “Reference” for this collection on sunnah.com

Further notes:

* Some hadiths have single letter suffixes (a, b, c...) after the same hadith number (e.g. 4290). The suffixed hadiths will all appear on the same page for the hadith number, but also from there the suffixed hadiths can be clicked individually for a unique url. 

**Ahmad Hasan reference** = The hadith number from the Ahmad Hasan translation of Sunan Abu Dawud.

Corresponds to the “English translation” hadith number (but not book number) for this collection on sunnah.com

Further notes:

* There were many editions of Ahmad Hasan's translation of Sunan Abu Dawud, first in 1984 with the hadiths divided into 36 books. In the 1990 edition they were divided into 41 books. In the latest edition in 2012, they have returned to the 36 book format. The hadith numbers remained unchanged across all editions.
* “English translation” on sunnah.com is divided into 42 books, which does not match any known edition of Ahmad Hasan's translation.
* For these two reasons the Ahmad Hasan reference on QuranX omits any book numbers and just uses his hadith numbers.

**USC-MSA web (English) reference** = the book and hadith number found in the partial Sunan Abu Dawud collection on the CMJE (USC-MSA) website, which includes approximately half of the hadiths found in Ahmad Hasan's translation. The hadith numbers are those of his translation, and the 41 book numbers correspond to the 1990 edition.

Further notes:

* Therefore, where a hadith has both an Ahmad Hasan reference and a USC-MSA web (English) reference on QuranX, the hadith numbers are identical.
* Perhaps USC-MSA only had a partial collection due to copyright reasons if they could only get permission to reproduce half of it. 
* Single letter suffixes (a, b, c...) have been omitted. The CMJE (USC-MSA) website has these suffixes for some hadith numbers when there are multiple with the same numbering (e.g. Book 4, Hadith 1237).  Such hadiths will all appear on the same page for the hadith number on QuranX.
* QuranX omits the In-book reference found on sunnah.com in order to limit the number of indexes and because even the book numbering for this index is of unknown origin.

## Muwatta Malik

Translation is by ' A'isha Abdarahman Bewley, first published by Kegan Paul International. Used also on the CMJE (USC-MSA) and sunnah.com websites.

**USC-MSA web (English) reference** = the book and hadith number on the CMJE (USC-MSA) website. These in turn come from 'A'isha Bewley's translation (they omitted her section numbers).

Corresponds to “Arabic/English reference” (first 27 hadiths only) and “USC-MSA web (English)reference” (28th hadith onwards) on sunnah.com.

Further notes:

* Single letter suffixes (a, b, c...) have been omitted. The CMJE (USC-MSA) website has these suffixes for some hadith numbers when there are multiple with the same numbering (e.g. Book 36, Hadith 13).  Such hadiths will all appear on the same page for the hadith number on QuranX.

**Arabic reference** = Arabic reference on sunnah.com. The exact origin of this index is unknown. 

Further notes:
* The url on QuranX for this index is called In-book (the label was later corrected to Arabic reference, but the url was left unchanged for the sake of existing links to QuranX).
* QuranX does not include the “Sunnah.com reference” index for this collection as it only exists for some hadiths.

## Sunan Ibn Majah

Translation is by Nasiruddin Al-Khattab, published by Dar-us-Salam. Used also on the sunnah.com website.

**Dar-us-Salam reference** = the volume, book and hadith number found in the print edition of this collection in English and Arabic published by Dar-us-Salam.

**In-book reference** = the book number found in the Dar-us-salam edition, and either sunnah.com's incremental hadith number starting at 1 for each book (some books, e.g. books 2-8), or a number of unknown origin (most books in this collection).

Corresponds to the “In-book reference” in this collection on sunnah.com which they invented to give each hadith a unique url, or to the “Arabic reference”, respectively. The latter has the same book numbering system, but different hadith numbering.

## Al-Adab Al-Mufrad

Translation is by Rafiq Abdur Rahman, published by Dar-us-Salam. Also used by sunnah.com. Marked as 85% complete on sunnah.com.

Corresponds to “English translation” or (for some books e.g. book 40) “English reference” found on sunnah.com for this collection. They are two different labels for the same system.

**In-book reference** = the book number found in the Dar-us-salam edition, and sunnah.com's incremental hadith number starting at 1 for each book. 

Corresponds to the “In-book reference” for this collection on sunnah.com which they invented to give each hadith a unique url, or for some books where it doesn't exist (e.g. book 40), to “English reference” for this collection on sunnah.com. The book numbering is the same for both systems.

**Reference** = the hadith number found in the Dar-us-Salam English and Arabic print edition.

Corresponds to “Reference”, or for some books where it doesn't exist (e.g. book 40), to the hadith number from “English reference” on sunnah.com, which gives the same information.


Further notes:

* “Arabic reference” is found in some books (e.g. book 40), but is identical to the “English reference”, so is omitted on QuranX.

## Bulugh al-Maram

Translation is a loosely typed up version of the Dar-us-Salam translation by unknown translator(s). Also used on sunnah.com.

**English translation** = “English translation” or (for some books, e.g. book 4) “English reference” found on sunnah.com for this collection. They are two different labels for the same system.

**In-book reference** = “In-book reference” or (for some books, e.g. book 4) “Arabic reference”  for this collection on sunnah.com. In the former case sunnah.com created an incremental hadith number that starts at 1 for each book. The book numbering system is the same for both.

Further notes:

* “Reference” found in some books (e.g. book 3) doesn't exist for much of the collection on sunnah.com, so was omitted on QuranX.
* None of the numbering systems on sunnah.com match the Dar-us-Salam print edition.
* This collection is noted as 53% complete on sunnah.com

## Riyad as-Saliheen

Translated by Dr. Muhammad Amin and Abu Usamah Al-Arabi bin Razduq, published by Dar-us-Salam. Also used on sunnah.com.

**Dar-us-Salam reference** = the book and hadith number in the Dar-us-Salam English and Arabic print edition.

Corresponds to “Arabic/English reference” or (in a few cases e.g. book 2 hadith 687) “English reference” found on sunnah.com for this collection.

Further notes:

* The url on QuranX for this index is called In-book (the label was later corrected to Dar-us-Salam reference, but the url was left unchanged for the sake of existing links to QuranX).
* In all but a few hadiths in this collection the Arabic reference and English reference are identical on sunnah.com and given the combined label: “Arabic/English reference”. For this reason a separate Arabic reference was not considered worthwhile on QuranX.
* QuranX makes no use of the sunnah.com reference for this collection as it doesn't exist for book 1 (which contains most of the hadiths in the collection).
